Bethesda developed the game using a modified version of its [Engine](Creation)(Creation Engine), which allowed the accommodation of multiplayer gameplay and a more detailed game world than in previous games.\n\n*Fallout 76* was released to generally mixed reviews, with criticism for the game's numerous technical issues, overall design, lack of gameplay purpose, and initial absence of human [character](non-playable)(non-playable character)s. The game was the subject of [controversies](several)(List of video games notable for negative reception#Fallout 76 (2018)), chiefly with regard to the quality of physical content.

Other alleged issues included technical problems with the game's design and engine, as well as these concerns being ignored by senior management.

He also holds United States citizenship. He first achieved fame in the 1970s emerging from the London [rock](punk)(punk rock) scene as the lead singer of the group [X](Generation)(Generation X (band)). Subsequently, he embarked on a solo career which led to international recognition and made Idol a lead artist during the [MTV](MTV)-driven \"[British Invasion](Second)(Second British Invasion)\" in the US. The name \"Billy Idol\" was inspired by a schoolteacher's description of him as \"idle\".\n\nIdol began his music career in late 1976 as a guitarist in the punk rock band [Chelsea](Chelsea (band)). However, he soon left the group. With his former bandmate [James](Tony)(Tony James (musician)), Idol formed Generation X. With Idol as lead singer, the band achieved success in the United Kingdom and released three studio albums on [Records](Chrysalis)(Chrysalis Records), then disbanded. In 1981, Idol moved to New York City to pursue his solo career in collaboration with guitarist [Stevens](Steve)(Steve Stevens). His debut studio album, *[Idol](Billy)(Billy Idol (album))* (1982), was a commercial success. With music videos for singles \"[with Myself](Dancing)(Dancing with Myself)\" and \"[Wedding](White)(White Wedding (song))\" Idol soon became a staple of then newly-established [MTV](MTV).\n\nIdol's second studio album, *[Yell](Rebel)(Rebel Yell (album))* (1983), was a major commercial success, featuring hit singles \"[Yell](Rebel)(Rebel Yell (song))\" and \"[Without a Face](Eyes)(Eyes Without a Face (song))\".

The BMI is defined as the [mass](body)(human body weight) divided by the [square](square (algebra)) of the [height](body)(human height), and is expressed in [units](Units of measurement) of kg/m2, resulting from mass in [kilogram](kilogram)s and height in [metre](metre)s.\n\nThe BMI may be determined using a table}} or [chart](chart) which displays BMI as a function of mass and height using contour lines or colours for different BMI categories, and which may use other units of measurement (converted to [units](metric)(Metric system) for the calculation).}}\n\nThe BMI is a convenient [of thumb](rule)(rule of thumb) used to broadly categorize a person as *underweight*, *normal weight*, *overweight*, or *obese* based on tissue mass ([muscle](muscle), fat, and bone) and height. Major adult BMI classifications are underweight (under 18.5&nbsp;kg/m2), normal weight (18.5 to 24.9), overweight (25 to 29.9), and obese (30 or more).  When used to predict an individual's health, rather than as a statistical measurement for groups, the BMI has [limitations](#Limitations) that can make it less useful than some of the [alternatives](#Alternatives), especially when applied to individuals with [obesity](abdominal)(abdominal obesity), [stature](short)(short stature), or [high muscle mass](unusually)(Bodybuilding).\n\nBMIs under 20 and over 25 have been associated with higher all-cause mortality, with the risk increasing with distance from the 20\u201325 range.\n\n## History\n\n[[& BMI.png|thumb|Obesity and BMI](File:Obesity)]\n\n[Quetelet](Adolphe)(Adolphe Quetelet), a Belgian [astronomer](astronomer), mathematician, [statistician](statistician), and [sociologist](sociologist), devised the basis of the BMI between 1830 and 1850 as he developed what he called \"social physics\". Quetelet himself never intended for the index, then called the Quetelet Index, to be used as a means of medical assessment. Instead, it was a component of his study of l'homme moyen, or the average man. Que\n\n...

Data on 11,808 subjects from the National Health and Human Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) 1999\u20132004, showed that SBSI outperformed BMI, waist circumference, and [Body Shape Index (ABSI)](A)(Body Shape Index), an alternative to BMI.
