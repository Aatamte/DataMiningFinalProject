Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London.

If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4.

Let me start by searching for the film and then look for the character's actor.\n\nFirst, I'll use the search_pages function with the query \"Sunlight Pours Down\" to find the film's page. Then, I'll check the sections of that page to find any mentions of Ji Yeon-woo. Maybe there's a section about the cast or the main characters.\n\nOnce I have the film's page, I can use view_sections to see what sections are available. If there's a section titled something like \"Cast\" or \"Main Cast\", that's where the actor info would be. If not, maybe there's a section with details about the characters.\n\nIf I find the cast information, I'll need to read the entire section to extract the actor's name. If the page doesn't have that info, I'll have to try different queries or check related pages. Since the user mentioned it's a Korean drama, maybe there's another page with more details about the actor.\n\nI should also consider if the actor's name is mentioned in the film's description or in a different section. If I can't find it directly, maybe I need to look for the actor's biography or other related works. But given the constraints, I'll focus on the immediate search for the film's cast.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for the 2004 Korean drama 'Sunlight Pours Down'\nfilm_page = search_pages(\"Sunlight Pours Down\")[0]\ncontent = read_section(film_page['page_id'] + \":full\")\n\n# Check for cast information in the film's description\nif \"cast\" in content.lower():\n    print(\"=== Finding cast information ===\")\n    cast_section = view_sections(film_page['page_id'])[-1]  # Assume last section is cast\n    actor_info = read_section(film_page['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    if \"Ji Yeon-woo\" in actor_info.lower():\n        print(f\"\\n=== Ji Yeon-woo played by {actor_info.split('Ji Yeon-woo')[1].split(' ')[0]} ===\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Answer not found\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Answer not found\")\n</python>"

The initial code searched for \"Sunlight Pours Down\" and accessed the first result. Then, it checked if the content had \"cast\" and tried to find the cast section. However, the output said \"Answer not found\".\n\nHmm, maybe the film's description doesn't mention the cast directly. The code checked for \"cast\" in the content, but perhaps the cast information is in a different section or formatted differently. The user tried to use view_sections on the film page's sections and assumed the last one is cast, but maybe that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cast details are in a different part of the page. Let me think: sometimes films have a \"Cast\" section with a specific heading, but if the code didn't find it, maybe the search for \"cast\" was too broad. Or perhaps the actor's name is mentioned in a different context, like a separate section or a different part of the content.\n\nAnother approach: The user's code might not have found the cast section because the film's description didn't include it. Maybe the cast is listed in a different format, like a list of names with their roles, or perhaps the code didn't parse it correctly. \n\nSince the initial attempt failed, maybe I should try a different query. Let's think of other ways to find the actor. Maybe searching for \"Ji Yeon-woo\" directly in the film's page. But how? The code uses search_pages with the film title, but maybe there are multiple entries or different versions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should search for the actor's name in the entire content, not just the cast section. The user's code checked for \"cast\" in the content, but maybe the actor is mentioned elsewhere. \n\nWait, the user's code tried to find \"Ji Yeon-woo\" in the actor_info after reading the full content. But if the cast section wasn't found, maybe the code should search for the actor's name in the entire content. Let me adjust the code to search for \"Ji Yeon-woo\" in the full content. \n\nSo, the plan is: search for the film, read the entire content, then check if \"Ji Yeon-woo\" is present. If found,"
