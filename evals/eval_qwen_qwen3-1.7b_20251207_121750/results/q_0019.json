Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

The user mentioned using Python code with the functions provided.\n\nFirst, I'll use the search_pages function with the query \"Austin Butler\" to find relevant pages. Then, I'll look for sections that mention his education or skills. Since the answer might be in a section about his background, I'll check that.\n\nOnce I have the page content, I need to search for mentions of guitar or teaching. The read_section function can be used to get the entire content of a page. I'll look for keywords like \"guitar\" or \"teach\" to find the relevant information.\n\nIf the initial search doesn't find anything, I might need to try different queries or check related pages. But since the user allows up to two turns, I should focus on the first turn and see if I can find the answer. If not, I'll adjust the search strategy in the next turn.\n\nLet me write the code for the first turn. I'll use search_pages with \"Austin Butler\" and then check the sections. If the content contains mentions of guitar teaching, I'll extract the age from there. If not, I'll need to try another approach.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Austin Butler's education and skills\npages = search_pages(\"Austin Butler\")\nfor page in pages:\n    content = read_section(page['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    if \"teach himself to play guitar\" in content.lower():\n        print(f\"=== {page['title']} ===\")\n        print(content.lower().find(\"teach himself to play guitar\"))\n        break\n</python>"

          "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking at what age Austin Butler taught himself to play guitar. The previous code tried searching for pages related to Austin Butler and looked for the phrase \"teach himself to play guitar\" in the content. But the output was empty, which means the search didn't find any relevant information.\n\nHmm, maybe the query \"teach himself to play guitar\" isn't exactly what's in the content. Maybe the phrase is different, like \"teach himself to play guitar\" versus \"learn to play guitar\" or something else. Alternatively, the information might be in a different section, like his education or career history.\n\nSince the first search didn't find anything, I need to try a different approach. Maybe the answer is in his biography or somewhere else. Let me think of alternative keywords. Maybe \"Austin Butler\" plus \"education\" or \"skills\". Or perhaps looking for his early experiences.\n\nWait, the user's question is about teaching himself, so maybe the answer is in his early career or personal history. Let me try searching for \"Austin Butler education\" to see if that reveals any information about his learning habits. Alternatively, maybe looking for \"Austin Butler guitar\" or \"Austin Butler learn guitar\".\n\nAnother idea: The answer might be in the section titled \"Education\" or \"Career\". Let me check if those sections exist. If I can view the sections of the page, I can look for those terms.\n\nSo, in the next step, I should use view_sections to check if there's a section named \"Education\" or \"Career\". Then, read that section to find the relevant information. If the section exists, I can extract the text and look for the age mentioned.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is in a different part of the page. Let me try to search for \"Austin Butler\" again with different parameters, maybe using a more specific query. But since the first search didn't find anything, I need to adjust the keywords.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is in the section titled \"Early Life\" or \"Career Highlights\". Let me try to view those sections. If I can find the section, then read it, I can look for any mentions of guitar or teaching himself.\n\nSo the plan is: first, check if there's a section titled \"Education\" or \"Career\". If yes, read that section and look for the age. If not, try other sections or keywords.\n\nBut since I can only do one search in this final turn, maybe I"
