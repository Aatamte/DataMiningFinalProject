Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

The user mentioned using Python code with the functions provided.\n\nFirst, I'll use the search_pages function with the query \"Godfather of House\". The goal is to find pages related to this title. Let's assume the first result is a Wikipedia page about an artist. Then, I need to read the full content of that page to find the answer.\n\nIf the initial search returns a page with the artist's name, I can extract the answer. If not, maybe the query is too broad, so I might need to adjust the search term. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is in a different section, like a biography or a discography.\n\nWait, the user provided an example where they searched for a film's director and found the university. Similarly, here, after searching for \"Godfather of House\", I should look for the artist's name in the page content. If the first result is the correct page, I'll read the full section and check for the answer. If not, maybe try a different search term or look into related sections.\n\nLet me write the code. First, search for \"Godfather of House\" to get the page ID. Then read the full content. Check if the artist's name is mentioned there. If found, that's the answer. If not, maybe try another approach.\n\nBut since I have only two turns, I need to be efficient. Let's proceed step by step.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for the 'Godfather of House' artist\nresults = search_pages(\"Godfather of House\")\nif results:\n    page_id = results[0]['page_id']\n    content = read_section(page_id + \":full\")\n    if \"Godfather of House\" in content.lower():\n        print(f\"=== {results[0]['title']} ===\")\n        print(content.lower().find(\"Godfather of House\") > 0 and content[max(0, content.lower().index(\"Godfather of House\") - 100):content.lower().index(\"Godfather of House\")+200] or content)\nelse:\n    print(\"<answer>Answer not found</answer>\")\n</python>"
