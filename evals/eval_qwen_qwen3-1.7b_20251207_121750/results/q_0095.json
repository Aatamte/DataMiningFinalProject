Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

The user is asking where to find the official list of Star Studios movies online. \n\nFirst, I need to search for \"Star Studios\" on Wikipedia. The function search_pages can be used here. Let me start by searching for the page title \"Star Studios\" to get a list of related pages.\n\nOnce I have the results, I'll check the first few pages to see if there's a section that mentions the official movie list. The user might be looking for a specific page like \"Star Studios (company)\" or something similar. \n\nIf the initial search doesn't find it, I might need to look into related pages or sections. Maybe there's a page that lists movies under the company. Alternatively, I could search for \"Star Studios movies\" directly to find the relevant page.\n\nI should also consider using view_sections() to check if there's a section titled \"Movies\" or something similar in the page. If the page has such a section, I can read it to find the official list.\n\nIf the first search doesn't yield results, I'll try different queries or check related pages. The answer might be in a section that's not immediately obvious, so I need to be thorough.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Star Studios page\nstar_studios_page = search_pages(\"Star Studios\")[:1]\n\nif star_studios_page:\n    print(f\"Found Star Studios page: {star_studios_page[0]['title']}\")\n    # Check if there's a 'Movies' section\n    sections = view_sections(star_studios_page[0]['page_id'])\n    print(\"Sections in Star Studios page:\")\n    for s in sections:\n        print(s['section_id'], s['section_name'])\n    \n    # Read the full content of the Star Studios page\n    content = read_section(star_studios_page[0]['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    if \"Movies\" in content.lower():\n        print(\"\\n=== Official Star Studios Movies List ===\")\n        print(content.lower().split(\"Movies\")[1].split(\"\\n\")[0])\nelse:\n    print(\"Star Studios page not found.

          "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking where to find the official list of Star Studios movies online. \n\nFirst, I need to search for pages related to Star Studios. The initial attempt used \"Star Studios\" and found a page, but maybe the section isn't directly under that. The code checked sections of the Star Studios page and found a 'Movies' section. But when reading the content, it didn't find the exact phrase \"Movies\" in the lowercased text. Maybe the section title is different, like \"Movies List\" or something similar.\n\nWait, the code tried to split on \"Movies\" but perhaps the section title is part of the content. Alternatively, maybe the movies are listed under a different section. The code then tried searching for \"Star Studios movies\" directly, which might have found a relevant page. However, the code only printed the title and didn't read the full content yet.\n\nIn the final turn, the user needs to provide the answer. The code should check if the movies page exists and read its content. If the content includes a link or a section that mentions the official list, that's the answer. If not, maybe the answer is that it's not found. But since the user is in the final turn, I need to simulate the code that would find the answer.\n\nAssuming that after searching \"Star Studios movies\", the code finds a page with the official list, the answer would be the URL or the link provided there. If not, maybe the answer is that it's not found. But given that the user wants a partial or uncertain answer, perhaps the code would output the URL from the movies page.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Check if \"Star Studios movies\" directly leads to the list\nmovies_page = search_pages(\"Star Studios movies\")[:1]\nif movies_page:\n    print(f\"Found Star Studios movies page: {movies_page[0]['title']}\")\n    content = read_section(movies_page[0]['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    if \"official list\" in content.lower():\n        print(\"\\n=== Official Star Studios Movies List ===\")\n        print(content.lower().split(\"official list\")[0])\n    else:\n        print(\"No official list found in the movies page.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Star Studios movies page not found.
