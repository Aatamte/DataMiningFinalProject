Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London.

The FAA classifies airports into different categories based on their size and activity. A medium hub airport is likely one that serves as a major transportation hub, so I need to find the specific range of passenger enplanement numbers that fall into this category.\n\nFirst, I should search for the FAA classification guidelines. The FAA's airport classifications are usually based on metrics like total annual passenger enplanements, total annual departures, and other factors. I remember that the FAA uses a system where airports are categorized into different classes, such as Class A (major international), B (intermediate), C (local), etc. But I need to confirm the exact criteria for a medium hub.\n\nI'll start by searching for \"FAA airport classification\" to get the relevant information. The search might return pages about FAA classifications, which would include details on how airports are categorized. Once I find the relevant page, I can look for sections that discuss passenger enplanement ranges.\n\nIf the search returns a list of pages, I'll need to check each one. The user mentioned using the functions provided: search_pages, view_sections, and read_section. So I'll use search_pages with the query \"FAA airport classification\" to get a list of pages. Then, I'll check each page's sections to find the relevant information.\n\nFor example, if the search returns a page titled \"FAA Airport Classification,\" I can use view_sections to see the available sections. If there's a section named \"Passenger Enplanement\" or something similar, I can read the entire section to extract the range. If the page doesn't have that information, I might need to look for other sections or use a different query.\n\nAnother approach is to search for \"medium hub airport FAA classification\" directly. If that doesn't return the needed information, I might need to search for \"passenger enplanement range FAA\" or similar terms. The key is to find the specific range that defines a medium hub airport.\n\nOnce I have the correct information, I can extract it from the content. If the search returns nothing, I'll have to conclude that the answer isn't found. However, since this is a hypothetical scenario, I'll proceed with the assumption that the information exists.\n\nLet me write the code step by step. First, search for the FAA classification pages. Then, check each"
