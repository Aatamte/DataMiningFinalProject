Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

Once I get the page details, I'll look into sections like \"Voice Actors\" or \"Cast\" to find her role. \n\nIf the initial search doesn't yield results, maybe I need to look for related pages or sections. Also, using the read_section function with the page_id + \":full\" might help get the entire content. \n\nI should check if there's a section titled something like \"Cast\" or \"Voice Actors.\" If I find her name in that section, the character should be listed there.

The previous code tried to search for \"Frozen II\" and check if Evan Rachel Wood is mentioned. But the output said \"Frozen II Not Found.\" So maybe the code didn't find the correct page.\n\nHmm, perhaps the film's title isn't exactly \"Frozen II\" in the search. Maybe there's a different name or a typo. Alternatively, maybe the page isn't in the first result. Let me try searching for \"Frozen II\" again but maybe with a different query. Wait, the user is asking about Frozen II, which is the second movie in the Frozen series. The first one was Frozen, then Frozen II.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should look for the character's name in the context of the film. The code checked if \"Evan Rachel Wood\" is in the content, but maybe she wasn't mentioned there. Let me think. Evan Rachel Wood is an actress known for playing Elsa in Frozen, but in Frozen II, she's not the voice of a main character. Wait, no, in Frozen II, she voices Anna, but maybe the code didn't find that. Or perhaps the code needs to look for the character's name in the sections.\n\nWait, the previous code used read_section with the page_id + \":full\" to get the entire content. But maybe the page isn't the correct one. Let me try searching for \"Frozen II\" again, but maybe using a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the code should search for \"Evan Rachel Wood\" in the context of Frozen II.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should look for the character's name in the sections. For example, if the page has sections like \"Main Characters\" or something similar. Let me try modifying the code to check for sections first.\n\nWait, the user's initial approach was to search for the film and then look for the director's education. Maybe here, instead of searching for the film first, I should search for the character. But the user's question is about Frozen II and Evan Rachel Wood's role.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should search for \"Evan Rachel Wood\" in the context of Frozen II. Let me try that.\n\nSo, the code could be adjusted to search for \"Evan Rachel Wood\" in the film's pages. But since the previous attempt didn't find it, maybe the code needs to look for the character's name in the sections. Let me try that.\n\n"
