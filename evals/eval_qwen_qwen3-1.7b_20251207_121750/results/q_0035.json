Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London.

If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

Let me start by searching for information about him.\n\nFirst, I'll use the search_pages function with the query \"Jesse Ventura professional wrestling\". That should give me some pages related to him. Let's see what the first result is.\n\nAssuming the first result is a page about his career, I'll check the content. The user mentioned that the answer might be in a section, so maybe there's a specific section for his ring name. I'll use view_sections to see if there's a section titled something like \"Ring Name\" or \"Wrestling Career\".\n\nIf the page has a section with the ring name, I can read that section. If not, maybe I need to look for other sections or different pages. If the first search doesn't find it, I'll try a different query, perhaps \"Jesse Ventura wrestling\" or \"Jesse Ventura career\".\n\nWait, the user said to use Python code and have two turns. So I need to do this in two steps. Let me write the code for the first search.\n\nFirst, search for \"Jesse Ventura professional wrestling\" to get the pages. Then check the sections. If the first page has the answer, extract it. If not, proceed to the next search.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# First search for Jesse Ventura's wrestling career\npages = search_pages(\"Jesse Ventura professional wrestling\")\nif pages:\n    # Check if the first page has a section for ring name\n    sections = view_sections(pages[0]['page_id'])\n    for section in sections:\n        if \"Ring Name\" in section['section_name']:\n            ring_name = read_section(pages[0]['page_id'] + \":full\")\n            print(f\"=== {pages[0]['title']} ===\")\n            print(ring_name)\n            break\nelse:\n    print(\"Answer not found\")\n</python>"

The user tried a Python script to search for his wrestling career and check if there's a section with \"Ring Name\". But the output was empty. So, maybe the script didn't find the right page or section.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure that the search for \"Jesse Ventura professional wrestling\" returned some results. If not, the script would proceed to the else clause and print \"Answer not found\". But in the user's case, the output was empty, which suggests that either there were no results, or the script didn't find the correct section.\n\nWait, maybe the initial search for \"Jesse Ventura professional wrestling\" didn't return any pages. So the code moved to the else block. But the user's output was empty, which might indicate that the script didn't find any pages. However, the user's code only printed \"Answer not found\" in that case. But the problem is that the user might have expected a different answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the script didn't find the correct section. For example, maybe the ring name is in a different section or the page isn't structured as expected. But the code checks for \"Ring Name\" in the section names. If that's not present, it would proceed to read the entire page.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe Jesse Ventura's wrestling career isn't documented in the pages the script is searching. But the user's question is about his ring name, which should be publicly known. However, if the search didn't find it, maybe there's a different way to approach it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial search was too broad. Maybe the script should use a more specific query, like \"Jesse Ventura wrestling career\" or \"Jesse Ventura ring name\". But the user's code used \"professional wrestling\", which is correct.\n\nWait, the user's code first searches for \"Jesse Ventura professional wrestling\" and then checks if there's a section with \"Ring Name\". If not, it prints \"Answer not found\". But in the output, the script returned nothing, so the code would print \"Answer not found\". However, the user's answer might expect a different approach.\n\nBut according to the rules, if the script can't find the answer, it should output \"Answer not found\". However, maybe there's a way to extract the ring name from the page content even if the section isn't explicitly named \"Ring Name\". For example, maybe"
