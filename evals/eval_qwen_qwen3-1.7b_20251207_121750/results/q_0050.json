Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London.

If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4.

The user mentioned \"Wolf Pack,\" so I'll use the search_pages function with that query.\n\nFirst, I'll check the first few results to see which page contains information about Wolf Pack. The search might return pages related to the show, maybe a main page or a detailed description. Once I find the correct page, I can read its entire content to look for the werewolf alpha character's name.\n\nIf the initial search doesn't find the answer quickly, I might need to look into sections or use regex to extract any mentions of the character. The answer could be in a section titled something like \"Main Characters\" or \"Cast.\" I'll use the view_sections function to check if there's a section that lists characters, then read the entire section to find the relevant information.\n\nI should also consider if the character's name is mentioned in the description or in any related pages. If the first attempt doesn't find it, I might need to try different queries or look into related topics like \"Werewolf\" or \"Wolf Pack characters.\" But since I have only two turns, I need to be efficient.\n\nLet me start by searching for \"Wolf Pack\" to get the main page. Then, check if there's a section with characters. If not, maybe look into the description text directly.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Wolf Pack TV series pages\nwolf_pack_pages = search_pages(\"Wolf Pack TV series\")[:5]\nprint(f\"Found {len(wolf_pack_pages)} pages related to Wolf Pack\")\n\n# Check first page for character info\nif wolf_pack_pages:\n    first_page = wolf_pack_pages[0]\n    content = read_section(first_page['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    if \"werewolf alpha\" in content.lower():\n        print(\"=== Found werewolf alpha info ===\")\n        print(content.lower().find(\"werewolf alpha\"))\n    else:\n        print(\"=== No direct mention of werewolf alpha ===\")\n</python>"

          "content": "<think>\nOkay, so the user is asking about the name of the werewolf alpha character in the TV series Wolf Pack. Let me think.\n\nFirst, I tried searching for \"Wolf Pack TV series\" and got five pages. The first page didn't have the word \"werewolf alpha\" directly. Hmm. Maybe the character's name is mentioned elsewhere in the page content.\n\nSince the search didn't find it directly, maybe I need to look for sections or other keywords. The user mentioned using view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages. So perhaps there's a section titled something like \"Characters\" or \"Main Cast\" that lists the werewolf alpha.\n\nLet me try using view_sections() on the first page to see what sections are available. If there's a section named \"Characters\", I can read that and look for the character's name. Alternatively, maybe there's a section named \"Main Cast\" or \"Cast\".\n\nWait, the user's code didn't use view_sections() in the previous attempt. Maybe I should add that step. So, in the Python code, after getting the first page's content, I can call view_sections() on that page ID to list all sections. Then, check if any of those sections mention the werewolf alpha.\n\nIf there's a section titled \"Characters\", I can read that section's content and look for the name. If not, maybe check other sections like \"Main Cast\" or \"Cast\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the character's name is mentioned in a different section. Let me try that approach. So, in the code, after getting the first page's content, I'll use view_sections() to get all sections, then iterate through them to find the one related to the werewolf alpha.\n\nIf I find the section, I can read its content and extract the name. If not, maybe the answer is not found. But since the user wants a partial or uncertain answer, I need to try different approaches.\n\nAnother possibility is that the character's name is mentioned in a different part of the page, like under a specific episode or episode number. But without more context, it's hard to tell. So, the best approach is to check all sections of the first page to see if any mention the werewolf alpha.\n\nLet me adjust the code to include view_sections() and then check each section's content.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Check sections of the first Wolf Pack page\nif wolf_pack_pages:\n    first_page = wolf_pack_pages[0]\n   "
