Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

Let me start by searching for episodes of Hannibal.\n\nFirst, I'll use the search_pages function with the query \"Hannibal episodes\". That should give me a list of pages related to Hannibal episodes. I'll take the first few results to see which ones are relevant.\n\nOnce I have the page IDs, I'll use read_section on each to get the full content. The goal is to find an episode that was pulled due to sensitive topics. I'll look for mentions of episodes being removed from the U.S. broadcast schedule. Maybe there's a section that discusses episode removals or sensitive content.\n\nIf the search returns multiple pages, I'll check each one. If I find the episode, I'll note the title and the reason. If not, I might need to try different queries or look for related terms like \"Hannibal episode removal\" or \"Hannibal sensitive content\".\n\nI should also check if there are any sections in the page that mention specific episodes. For example, maybe a section titled \"Episodes Removed\" or something similar. If the content is too long, I can use view_sections to break it down into sections and check each one.\n\nLet me write the code step by step. First, search for Hannibal episodes. Then, read the full content of each relevant page. Look for mentions of episode removals. If found, extract the episode title and the reason. If not, try another approach.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Hannibal episodes\nepisodes = search_pages(\"Hannibal episodes\")[:5]\nfor page in episodes:\n    content = read_section(page['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    if \"episode removed\" in content.lower():\n        print(f\"=== {page['title']} ===\")\n        print(content.lower().find(\"episode removed\") + 100)\n        break\n</python>"

The user is asking which episode of Hannibal was pulled from the U.S. broadcast schedule due to sensitive subject matter. \n\nFirst, I need to find information about episodes of Hannibal that were removed. The previous code tried searching for \"Hannibal episodes\" and checked if \"episode removed\" is in the content. But the output was empty, so maybe the code didn't find anything.\n\nHmm, perhaps the episode numbers are different. Maybe the code is looking for the exact phrase \"episode removed\" but the actual removals might have different wording. Alternatively, maybe the code needs to look for episodes that were removed due to content, not just any episode removed.\n\nI should adjust the search query. Maybe using \"Hannibal episode removal\" or \"Hannibal episode removed due to content\". Also, checking the specific episodes that were pulled. For example, Season 4, Episode 10 (The Drowning) was removed in the U.S. for content issues. \n\nAnother approach: search for episodes that were removed and check their titles. The code could look for episodes with \"removed\" in the title or description. Maybe using a different query like \"Hannibal episode removed\" or \"Hannibal episode pulled\".\n\nWait, the previous code used \"episode removed\" in the content. Maybe the actual removals have different phrases. Let me try modifying the search to look for \"Hannibal episode removed\" or similar. Also, check if the code can find the specific episode number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should look for episodes that were removed due to content, so searching for \"Hannibal episode pulled\" or \"Hannibal episode removed for content\". \n\nLet me try adjusting the code to use a different query and see if it finds the episode. If not, maybe the answer is known to be Season 4, Episode 10 (The Drowning), but I need to confirm via the code.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Hannibal episodes removed due to content\nepisodes = search_pages(\"Hannibal episode removed\")[:5]\nfor page in episodes:\n    content = read_section(page['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    if \"removed\" in content.lower():\n        print(f\"=== {page['title']} ===\")\n        print(content.lower().find(\"removed\") + 100)\n        break\n</python>"
