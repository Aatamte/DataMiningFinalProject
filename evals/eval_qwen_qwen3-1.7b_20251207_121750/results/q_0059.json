Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

Let's start by searching for information about Adam Conover and his academic background.\n\nFirst, I'll use the search_pages function with the query \"Adam Conover Bard College\" to find any pages related to his education. The result might include a page about his college years. Then, I'll check the sections of that page to find any mentions of comedy groups.\n\nIf the search returns a page with information about his college, I'll use view_sections to look for sections related to comedy groups. Maybe there's a section titled something like \"Comedy Groups\" or \"Academic Activities.\" Once I find that section, I can read the content to see if it mentions any groups he was part of.\n\nIf the initial search doesn't find anything, I might need to try a different query or check other pages. But since the user allows two turns, I should try to get the answer in the first turn.\n\nLet me write the code for the first step: search for Adam Conover and Bard College. Then, check the sections of the resulting page. If there's a section about comedy groups, read it and extract the answer.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Adam Conover's college information\nresults = search_pages(\"Adam Conover Bard College\")\nif results:\n    page_id = results[0]['page_id']\n    content = read_section(page_id + \":full\")\n    # Look for comedy groups in the page\n    for section in view_sections(page_id):\n        if \"comedy\" in section[\"section_name\"].lower():\n            print(f\"\\n=== {section['section_name']} ===\")\n            print(read_section(page_id + \":full\"))\n            break\nelse:\n    print(\"No results found for Adam Conover's college years.\")\n</python>"

The user is asking which comedy group Adam Conover was a member of during his college years at Bard College. \n\nFirst, I need to find information about Adam Conover's college years. The user tried using the search_pages function with \"Adam Conover Bard College\" and got no results. Then they tried viewing sections of the page, but the output was empty.\n\nHmm, maybe the initial search didn't find the right page. Maybe the page isn't directly available through the API? Or perhaps the information is in a different section. Let me think about possible approaches.\n\nSince the initial attempt didn't work, maybe I should try a different query. Maybe searching for \"Adam Conover Bard College\" again but with different parameters. Alternatively, maybe looking for his college years in a different way, like searching for \"comedy groups\" or \"Adam Conover comedy group\".\n\nWait, the user's code tried to search for pages related to Adam Conover and Bard College, but the results were empty. Maybe the page doesn't exist or is not accessible. Alternatively, maybe the section names aren't matching. Let me check the possible sections again.\n\nThe code uses view_sections to get all sections of the page. If the page doesn't have any sections related to comedy groups, then the code would not find anything. But maybe there's a section that mentions his college years and comedy groups.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the information is in a different part of the page. Maybe after the initial search, the code should look for sections that mention college years or Bard College specifically.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the user needs to search for \"Adam Conover\" and then look for his college years. But the initial code tried that. Alternatively, maybe the answer is known and the user needs to find it through another query.\n\nWait, I remember that Adam Conover was part of the comedy group \"The Groundlings\" during his college years at Bard College. But I need to confirm this.\n\nSince the initial code didn't find anything, perhaps the answer is in a different part. Let me try to search for \"Adam Conover comedy group\" or \"Bard College comedy groups\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should look for sections that mention Bard College and any comedy groups. Let me adjust the code to check for sections with \"Bard College\" in the section name and see if there's a comedy group mentioned.\n\nSo, modifying the code to look for sections with \"Bard College\" in the section name and"
