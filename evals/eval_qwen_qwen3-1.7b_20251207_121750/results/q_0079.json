Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

The user wants to know what injury caused Lil Durk to suspend performing and recording in July 2022. \n\nFirst, I need to find information about Lil Durk's injuries around that time. Since I can't access real-time data, I'll use Wikipedia's search functions. \n\nStarting with the first step: search for Lil Durk's injury. The query should be \"Lil Durk injury 2022\". Let me use the search_pages function with that query. \n\nLooking at the results, I need to check the first few pages. The first result might be a news article or a bio page. Once I get the page, I'll check the sections. Maybe there's a section titled \"Injury\" or something similar.\n\nIf the page doesn't have the injury info directly, I'll need to search for related terms like \"suspension\" or \"health issues\". Maybe there's a section about his health or career suspension. \n\nIf the initial search doesn't find it, I'll try different queries. For example, searching for \"Lil Durk 2022 injury\" or \"Lil Durk suspension cause\". \n\nOnce I find the relevant page, I'll read the entire content to extract the answer. The injury details might be in a section like \"Personal life\" or \"Career\". \n\nIf I don't find it after a few attempts, I'll have to conclude that the answer isn't found. But since the user expects an answer, I need to make sure I check all possible sections and queries.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# First search for Lil Durk's injury in 2022\nresults = search_pages(\"Lil Durk injury 2022\")\nif results:\n    page_id = results[0]['page_id']\n    content = read_section(page_id + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('injury')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {results[0]['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0, idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\nelse:\n    print(\"No results found for Lil Durk's injury in 2022\")\n</python>"

          "content": "<think>\nOkay, so the user is asking about the injury that caused Lil Durk to suspend performing and recording in July 2022. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to find information related to Lil Durk's injury in 2022. The previous code tried searching for \"Lil Durk injury 2022\" but the output was empty. That means maybe the search wasn't successful, or the injury isn't mentioned in the initial results.\n\nSince the first attempt didn't find any information, I should try a different approach. Maybe using a more general query or checking related sections. The user might have used a search term that wasn't specific enough, or the injury details are in a different part of the Wikipedia page.\n\nI should consider possible injuries related to Lil Durk. Common injuries in the music industry include things like back injuries, fractures, or other physical ailments. Maybe the injury was a back injury, which is a common issue for performers.\n\nAnother strategy is to search for \"Lil Durk 2022 injury\" or \"Lil Durk suspension 2022\" to see if that yields more results. If the initial search didn't find anything, trying a different query might help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the injury is mentioned in a section about his career or personal life. Using the view_sections function could help locate specific sections, like \"Personal Life\" or \"Career Highlights\".\n\nBut since I have only one turn left, I need to make the best guess based on available information. Given that the first search didn't return results, it's possible the injury wasn't directly mentioned in the initial pages. However, common knowledge might suggest a back injury as a possible cause for suspension.\n\nWait, but the user wants the answer based on the search results. Since the first attempt didn't find anything, maybe the answer is that the injury wasn't explicitly stated in the available pages, but common knowledge would say a back injury. However, according to the rules, I must use the search results. If no results are found, I have to output \"Answer not found\".\n\nBut the user's question is about a specific injury. If the search didn't find any information, then the answer would be that it's not found. However, perhaps there's a way to infer it from the context. But according to the instructions, I can't make up facts; I must use the search results.\n\nSince the first attempt didn't find any results"
