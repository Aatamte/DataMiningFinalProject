Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

First, I need to find out who Linda Blair is and what books she's associated with.\n\nSince the question mentions a book co-authored by her, I should start by searching for her name. Maybe there's a page about her that lists her works. Let me use the search_pages function with \"Linda Blair\" as the query.\n\nOnce I get the results, I need to look at the pages. The user mentioned a book from 2001, so I should check if any of the pages have a publication date around that time. The co-author's name might be mentioned in the book details.\n\nIf I find a page about her books, I can read the full content to see if there's a book from 2001. The answer might be in the section about her books or another part of the page. If the book is listed, I can extract the title and the lifestyle promoted.\n\nWait, the question says she co-authored the book. So the book's author would be her and another person. I need to check if the co-author is mentioned, maybe in the book's title or description.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the book's title is mentioned in the context of her lifestyle. For example, a book titled \"Lifestyle 2001\" or something similar. But I need to search for that.\n\nAnother approach: check if there's a section in the page about her books. If the search_pages returns a list of pages, I can use view_sections to find the specific sections. Then read the content to find the book details.\n\nLet me start by searching for Linda Blair's pages. If there's a page about her books, I can check the sections. If not, maybe look for other sources.\n\nOnce I have the book details, I can extract the lifestyle promoted. The answer is likely the title of the book and the lifestyle, but I need to confirm.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Linda Blair's pages\npages = search_pages(\"Linda Blair\")\nif not pages:\n    print(\"No pages found for Linda Blair.\")\nelse:\n    # Check if any of the pages mention books\n    for page in pages:\n        if \"book\" in page[\"title\"].lower():\n            print(f\"=== {page['title']} ===\")\n            content = read_section(page[\""

The user is asking about Linda Blair co-authoring a book promoting a lifestyle she adopted in 2001. \n\nFirst, I need to find Linda Blair's pages. The previous code tried searching for \"Linda Blair\" and got some results. But in the final turn, the code was interrupted. So I need to continue from where it left off.\n\nThe user's previous attempt had a code snippet that started searching for Linda Blair's pages. The code checked if any of the pages mention books. However, in the next step, the code was cut off. So I need to complete that code.\n\nThe code after the initial check would look for pages where the title includes \"book\" or something related. Then, it would read the content of those pages to find mentions of co-authored books and the lifestyle adopted in 2001.\n\nI should use the search_pages function with \"Linda Blair\" to get the relevant pages. Then, for each page, check if there's a mention of a book. Once a page with a book is found, read the entire content to find the specific information.\n\nLooking at the possible answers, the lifestyle she adopted in 2001 is likely \"low-carb diet\" or something similar. But I need to confirm this by checking the content of the pages.\n\nIf the code is run, it should find the page where Linda Blair co-authored a book about a lifestyle she adopted in 2001. The answer would be the name of that lifestyle, like \"low-carb diet\" or \"clean eating\".\n\nSince the code is in the final turn, I need to make sure that the code completes correctly. If the code finds the page, it will print the content and extract the answer. If not, the answer might be \"Answer not found\".\n\nBut given that Linda Blair is known for her role in \"The Ring\" and later films, maybe she co-authored a book on health or diet. The answer is likely \"low-carb diet\" or similar.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Continue searching for Linda Blair's pages\npages = search_pages(\"Linda Blair\")\nif not pages:\n    print(\"No pages found for Linda Blair.\")\nelse:\n    # Check if any of the pages mention books\n    for page in pages:\n        if \"book\" in page[\"title\"].lower():\n            print(f\"=== {page['title']} ===\")\n            content = read_section"
