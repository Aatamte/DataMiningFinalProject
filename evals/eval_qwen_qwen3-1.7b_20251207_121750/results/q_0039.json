Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

I need to find out what role he held during that time.\n\nFirst, I should search for Marco Rubio's career history. The initial approach might be to look up his page on Wikipedia. Using the search_pages function with \"Marco Rubio\" could get him. Then, I need to read the full content of his page to find any information about his legislative roles.\n\nOnce I have the page content, I should check for sections related to his political positions. Maybe there's a section titled \"Political offices\" or something similar. If the page doesn't have that, I might need to look for other sections or use regex to find mentions of his roles.\n\nIf the direct search doesn't find it, perhaps looking for keywords like \"Florida House of Representatives\" or \"2006-2008\" could help. But since the user specified the time frame, I should focus on that.\n\nWait, the user mentioned the Florida House of Representatives from 2006 to 2008. So I need to confirm if he was a member there during that period. Maybe the page has a section about his legislative service. If not, maybe looking at other sections like \"Education\" or \"Publications\" could help, but that's less likely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the page has a section titled \"Political offices\" where he listed his positions. Let me try to structure the code steps:\n\n1. Search for Marco Rubio's page.\n2. Read the full content to check for relevant sections.\n3. Look for any mentions of his roles in the Florida House of Representatives during 2006-2008.\n4. If found, extract the position name.\n\nIf the initial search doesn't find it, maybe try different queries or check other sections. But since the user wants an answer, I need to make sure the code is thorough.\n\nLet me write the Python code step by step. First, search for Marco Rubio's page. Then read the full content. Check for sections and keywords.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Marco Rubio's page\nmarco_rubio_page = search_pages(\"Marco Rubio\")[0]\n\n# Read the full content of the page\ncontent = read_section(marco_rubio_page['page_id'] + \":full\")\n\n# Check for political offices section\npolitical_off"

I need to find out what office he held during that time.\n\nFirst, I should search for Marco Rubio's page. The previous code tried that and got the first result. Then, they tried to read the full content. The next step is to check if there's a section about his political offices.\n\nIn the code, after getting the page, they tried to check for \"political offices\" section. But maybe the actual information is in a different part. Maybe the content has a section titled \"Political offices\" or similar. The code should look for that section.\n\nIf the content doesn't have that section, maybe the user needs to search for other keywords like \"chairman\", \"member\", or \"representative\". Also, the code might need to use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages. For example, if the page has a section named \"Political Offices\" or \"Office Holdings\".\n\nOnce the correct section is found, extract the details. The answer should be the position he held, like \"Representative\" or \"Chairman\". If the code can't find it, then output \"Answer not found\".\n\nWait, in the previous attempt, the code tried to check for \"political offices\" but maybe the section is named differently. Let me adjust the code to look for possible sections. Also, check if the content has a part where he's listed as a member of the House.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is in the initial content. For example, if the page mentions he was a Representative from Florida's 4th district during that period. The code should extract that information.\n\nIf the code can't find it, then the answer is not found. But since the user is in the final turn, I need to provide the answer based on the code's ability to find it.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Check for political offices section in the full content\npolitical_offices_section = None\nfor section in view_sections(marco_rubio_page['page_id']):\n    if 'Political Offices' in section['section_name']:\n        political_offices_section = section['section_id']\n        break\n\nif political_offices_section:\n    # Read the full content of the section\n    content = read_section(political_offices_section + \":full\")\n    # Extract the position from the content\n    position = content.lower"
