Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

          "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about a phrase from NAFO that's used to mock pro-Russian accounts spreading false claims. First, I need to figure out what NAFO refers to. NAFO is an acronym for the North Atlantic Free Trade Area, but maybe in this context it's a different organization. Alternatively, it could be a colloquial term or a specific group.\n\nSince the question mentions \"mock pro-Russian accounts,\" I'm thinking of terms related to Russian propaganda or disinformation. The phrase in question is likely a satirical or mocking term used by some groups to refer to pro-Russian claims. \n\nI remember that in some contexts, \"NAFO\" might be a play on words or a specific term. Maybe it's a reference to the North Atlantic Free Trade Area, but with a twist. Alternatively, maybe it's related to the term \"NATO\" or another alliance. But since the user specified NAFO, I need to focus on that.\n\nI should search for pages related to NAFO and look for any mentions of phrases used to mock pro-Russian accounts. The search might need to be adjusted with specific keywords. Let me try using the search_pages function with \"NAFO\" as the query. \n\nOnce I get the results, I'll check each page's content to see if there's a phrase that fits. If the initial search doesn't find it, I might need to look into sections or use different keywords. For example, maybe the phrase is part of a specific article or discussion forum related to NAFO.\n\nAnother approach could be to look for terms like \"disinformation\" or \"propaganda\" in the context of NAFO. The answer might be a specific term like \"NAFO's own\" or something similar, but I need to verify.\n\nLet me start by searching for NAFO-related pages and check the content. If the first result doesn't have the answer, I'll try another query or look into sections of the page.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for NAFO-related pages\nresults = search_pages(\"NAFO\")\nif results:\n    # Check the first result for relevant content\n    page_id = results[0]['page_id']\n    content = read_section(page_id + \":full\")\n    if \"mock pro-Russian\" in content.lower():\n        print(\"=== Found phrase ===\")\n        print(content)\n    else:\n        print(\"NAFO pages not found with mock pro-Russian references\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No NAFO"

The user is asking about a phrase from NAFO that mocks pro-Russian accounts spreading false claims. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what NAFO is. NAFO stands for North Atlantic Fishery Management Council, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Wait, the question mentions \"pro-Russian accounts\" and a phrase used to mock them. Maybe it's related to some organization or group that deals with Russian interests.\n\nThe user previously tried searching for NAFO pages and found a page where \"mock pro-Russian\" was mentioned. But in the final turn, they need to provide the answer now. The previous code searched for NAFO and checked if any content included \"mock pro-Russian\". If the code found that, it would print the content. However, in the previous attempt, the code might not have found the exact phrase.\n\nSince the user is in the final turn, I need to make sure that the answer is extracted correctly. The code from the previous attempt might have printed the content where the phrase was found. But if not, maybe there's a different approach. \n\nWait, in the previous code, they checked if \"mock pro-Russian\" is in the content. If so, it prints the content. But maybe the exact phrase is different. For example, perhaps the phrase is \"mock pro-Russian\" but in a different context. Alternatively, maybe the answer is \"NAFO\" itself, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phrase is \"pro-Russian\" being mocked, and the answer is a specific term. But without seeing the actual content from the search, it's hard to tell. However, since the user is expecting an answer, and in the previous code they found that the content included \"mock pro-Russian\", then the answer would be the phrase itself. But maybe the code didn't output it, so I need to check again.\n\nWait, in the previous code, if the results are not empty, they check the first page. If \"mock pro-Russian\" is found, they print the content. Otherwise, they say NAFO pages not found. But if the code didn't find it, then the answer would be \"Answer not found\". However, the user is in the final turn and needs an answer.\n\nGiven that the user's previous code might have found the phrase, but in the final turn, the assistant needs to output the answer.
