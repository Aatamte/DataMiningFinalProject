Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

Let's start by searching for the show 'Idol' on Wikipedia.\n\nFirst, I'll use the search_pages function with the query \"Idol\" to find relevant pages. The result might include a page about the show. Let's check the first few results.\n\nOnce I get the page, I need to look for sections that mention the Billboard chart. Maybe there's a section titled \"Chart performance\" or something similar. Using view_sections to get the list of sections, I can check which one contains the chart data.\n\nIf the section is found, I'll read the entire content of that section using read_section. Then, search for mentions of the Billboard Japan Hot 100 chart and extract the consecutive weeks. The answer might be in a section that lists the chart positions over time.\n\nIf the initial search doesn't find the answer, I'll try different queries or check other sections. But since I have only two turns, I need to be efficient. Let's proceed step by step.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for the 'Idol' show on Wikipedia\npages = search_pages(\"Idol\")\nif pages:\n    # Check the first page for relevant sections\n    sections = view_sections(pages[0]['page_id'])\n    for section in sections:\n        if \"Billboard Japan Hot 100 chart\" in section['section_name']:\n            content = read_section(pages[0]['page_id'] + \":full\")\n            print(f\"=== {section['section_name']} ===\")\n            print(content)\n            break\nelse:\n    print(\"No page found for 'Idol'.\")\n</python>"

          "content": "<think>\nOkay, so the user is asking how many consecutive weeks 'Idol' topped the Billboard Japan Hot 100 chart. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to find the Wikipedia page for 'Idol' and check the sections related to the Billboard chart. The previous code tried searching for 'Idol' and checked sections for the Billboard chart, but the output was empty. That might mean either no section was found or there was an error in the search.\n\nSince the initial attempt didn't find any sections, maybe I should try a different approach. Maybe the page isn't named exactly 'Idol' but something else, like 'Idol (TV Show)' or 'Idol (Billboard Chart)'. Alternatively, perhaps the section isn't directly titled with the chart name but mentions it indirectly.\n\nAnother strategy is to search for \"Billboard Japan Hot 100 chart\" directly to find relevant pages. But the user specified 'Idol' as the show, so maybe the page is named 'Idol' and the section is titled something else. Let me try adjusting the search query to look for 'Idol' and check all sections again.\n\nWait, in the previous code, they used view_sections on the first page. If that didn't find the section, maybe the page has multiple sections or the section is in a different part. Maybe I should search for 'Idol' and then check all sections, not just the first one. Also, maybe the section is titled \"Chart Performance\" or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is in a different language, but the user is asking in English. Let me try to search for 'Idol' again and check all sections. If that still doesn't work, maybe the answer is in a different context, like a different Wikipedia page or a related article.\n\nAnother possibility is that the 'Idol' show was a TV show, and the Billboard chart might be for a different period. But the user is asking about consecutive weeks, so maybe the answer is 12 weeks or something like that. However, without the actual data, I can't be sure.\n\nSince the previous code didn't find any sections, perhaps the answer is in a different part of the page. Let me try to search for 'Idol' again and check all sections, then look for any mentions of the Billboard chart. If no section is found, maybe the answer is not available on Wikipedia, and I should state that.\n\n"
