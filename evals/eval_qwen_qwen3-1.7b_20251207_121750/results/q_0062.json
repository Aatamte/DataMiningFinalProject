Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

The user wants to know who the writer of the 2023 South Korean TV series \"The Good Bad Mother\" is. \n\nFirst, I need to find the title of the series. The title given is \"The Good Bad Mother\", so I'll start by searching for that on Wikipedia. Using the search_pages function with the query \"The Good Bad Mother\" should return the relevant page.\n\nOnce I get the page, I'll check the sections to find the writer. The user mentioned that the answer might be in a specific section, so maybe there's a \"Writer\" or \"Credits\" section. I'll use view_sections() to see what sections are available and then read the full content of the page to find the information.\n\nIf the direct search doesn't find the writer, I might need to look for related keywords like \"writer\" or \"credits\". The search should be thorough, but since the user has only two turns, I need to make sure I don't overcomplicate it. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, search for the series title. Then check the sections to find the writer's name. If found, output it. If not, try different approaches.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for the TV series\nseries_page = search_pages(\"The Good Bad Mother\")[0]\ncontent = read_section(series_page['page_id'] + \":full\")\n\n# Look for writer information in the content\nwriter_match = re.search(r'Writer:.*?(\\w+)', content.lower())\nif writer_match:\n    print(f\"=== {series_page['title']} ===\")\n    print(f\"Writer: {writer_match.group(1)}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Writer not found in this page.\")\n</python>"

          "content": "<think>\nOkay, so the user is asking about the writer of the 2023 South Korean TV series \"The Good Bad Mother.\" Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to find the correct page for the series. The initial code tried searching for \"The Good Bad Mother\" and got the first result. But the content didn't mention the writer. The code used a regex to look for \"Writer:\" followed by a name, but didn't find anything. \n\nHmm, maybe the series page doesn't list the writer directly. Sometimes, the writer might be mentioned in a different section, like behind the scenes or credits. Let me check if there's another way to find the writer. \n\nThe user mentioned using the view_sections function to look for specific sections in large pages. Maybe there's a section titled \"Cast\" or \"Credits\" that lists the writers. Let me try using view_sections on the series page to see what sections are available. \n\nWait, in the initial code, they used search_pages to get the first result and then read the full content. But maybe the writer is in a different section. So, I should first check the sections of the series page to see if there's a section related to the writer. \n\nSo, in the next step, I'll use view_sections on the series page to list all sections. Then, check if any of those sections contain the writer's name. If there's a \"Credits\" or \"Cast\" section, I can read that and look for the writer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the writer is mentioned in a different part of the content, like in an episode or behind-the-scenes article. But since the user's initial search didn't find it, perhaps I need to look for other keywords like \"writer,\" \"scripted by,\" or \"screenplay\" in the content. \n\nAnother possibility is that the series was written by a different person, and the code didn't account for that. But the question is specifically about the writer of the series, so I need to find that information. \n\nLet me adjust the code to first view the sections of the series page and then check each section for possible writer information. If that doesn't work, maybe try searching for the writer's name using different keywords or check other pages. \n\nBut since I only have one more turn, I need to be efficient. Let's try viewing the sections of the series page first. If there's a \"Credits\" section, I can read that"
