Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London.

If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4.

          "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which horror film from 2019 featured Kiernan Shipka as a deaf teenager. \n\nFirst, I need to find films released in 2019 that are horror movies. Then, check if Kiernan Shipka is in them and if she plays a deaf teenager.\n\nStarting with the first step: searching for 2019 horror films. The search query could be \"2019 horror film\". Using the search_pages function with that query. Let's see what pages are returned.\n\nOnce I get the list of films, I need to look for Kiernan Shipka in their cast. The next step is to check each film's details. If the film is horror, then check if Kiernan Shipka is in the cast and if her character is a deaf teenager.\n\nBut how to extract that information? Maybe looking for the cast members in the film's description. If the search_pages returns a list of films, each with a page_id and title, then I can read the full content of each film's page to find the cast.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a specific section in the Wikipedia pages for the films. For example, the \"Cast\" or \"Credits\" section. But since the user mentioned using the functions provided, I need to use read_section with the page_id + \":full\" to get the entire content.\n\nSo, first, I'll perform a search for 2019 horror films. Then, for each result, check if Kiernan Shipka is in the cast and if her character's description includes being deaf and a teenager.\n\nLet me draft the code. First, search for 2019 horror films. Then iterate through each result, check the cast, and see if Kiernan Shipka is there. If found, then check the character description for the deaf teenager part.\n\nBut if the initial search returns no results, I need to try different queries. Maybe \"2019 horror film with Kiernan Shipka\" or similar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the film is \"The Babadook\" which I recall has a deaf character. But I need to confirm.\n\nWait, The Babadook is a 2014 film. So that's not 2019. Maybe \"The Babadook\" is a 2014 film, but there's another one. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, \"The Gift\""

          "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the answer. The question is asking for a 2019 horror film where Kiernan Shipka plays a deaf teenager.\n\nFirst, I need to find films from 2019 that are horror. Let's start by searching for \"2019 horror film\". The search_pages function will return some results. Let's assume the first result is a film like \"The Babadook\" but that's 2014. Maybe another film.\n\nWait, maybe \"The Babadook\" is not 2019. Let me think of other horror films from 2019. There's \"The Witch\" which is 2015, so no. \"The Conjuring\" is 2013. \"Get Out\" is 2017. \"The Others\" is 2017. \"The Babadook\" is 2014. \n\nWait, maybe \"The Babadook\" was re-released in 2019? Or perhaps there's another film. Alternatively, maybe \"The Babadook\" is the correct answer, but I need to check if Kiernan Shipka is in it. \n\nKiernan Shipka is a actress, so I need to check if she's in the cast of a 2019 horror film. Let me think. If the search for \"The Babadook\" returns that she's in it, then maybe that's the answer. But I need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"The Babadook\" is not the correct film. Let me try to search for Kiernan Shipka in 2019 horror films.\n\nSo, the code would first search for 2019 horror films. Then, for each film, check if Kiernan Shipka is in the cast. If she is, then check if her character is a deaf teenager.\n\nBut since I can only do one search in this turn, maybe the answer is \"The Babadook\" even if it's not 2019. Wait, but the question specifies 2019. So perhaps there's another film.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"The Babadook\" is the correct answer and it's 2019. Let me check.\n\nWait, I think \"The Babadook\" was released in 2014. So that's not 201"
