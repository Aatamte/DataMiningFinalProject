Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

Then, I'll check the sections of that page to see if there's any mention of awards. If the book is found, I'll read the entire content to look for award information.\n\nIf the search returns the book page, I'll use view_sections to see if there's a section titled something like \"Awards\" or \"Nominations.\" If that's not there, I'll look through the content directly. Maybe the award is mentioned in a section like \"Biography\" or \"Contributions.\" \n\nIf I don't find the award in the initial search, I might need to try different keywords or check other related pages. But since I have two turns, I should focus on the first turn to get as much information as possible. If the book isn't found, I'll have to say the answer isn't found. \n\nLet me write the code for the first turn: search for the book, then check the sections and content for any mentions of awards. If found, extract the award name; if not, proceed to the next step.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for the book and its related pages\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the book and look for award info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Shelby Steele The Content of Our Character\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('won')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for award-related sections in the book's page\nif 'Awards' in view_sections(r['page_id'] for r in search_pages(\"Shelby Steele The Content of Our Character\")):\n    print(\"\\n=== Awards Section ===\")\n    for r in search_pages(\"Awards\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n        content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n        print(content)\n</python>"

The user tried using the search_pages function with the book title, but there was an error. Maybe the page wasn't found, so I need to check again.\n\nWait, the error message says \"Page not found: <generator object ...>\". That probably means the search_pages function isn't returning the correct page IDs. Maybe the book title is different or there's a typo. Let me check the original question again. The book is \"The Content of Our Character\" by Shelby Steele. Maybe the search query should be more specific, like including the author's name.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the page exists but the initial search didn't find it because of a typo. Let me try searching for \"Shelby Steele The Content of Our Character\" again. If that doesn't work, maybe I need to search for the author's name separately.\n\nAnother approach: If the initial search didn't find the page, perhaps I should look for the author's biography first. Let's try searching for Shelby Steele's biography to find where his awards are mentioned. Then, check the awards section of that page.\n\nSo, first, search for Shelby Steele's biography. Then, check if there's an \"Awards\" section. If so, look for awards related to 1990 and his book.\n\nLet me adjust the code to first search for the author's page, then check sections. If the awards section is present, extract the information.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Shelby Steele's biography to find award info\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\nfor r in search_pages(\"Shelby Steele biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    if 'won' in content.lower():\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0, content.lower().find('won')-CONTEXT_BEFORE):content.lower().find('won')+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Check if awards section exists\nif 'Awards' in view_sections(r['page_id'] for r in search_pages(\"Shelby Steele biography\")):\n    print(\"\\n=== Awards Section ===\")\n    for r in search_pages(\"Awards\")"
