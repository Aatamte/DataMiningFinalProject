Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

I need to find out what her twin sister's name is.\n\nFirst, I should search for Linda Hamilton's information. Maybe there's a Wikipedia page about her. Let me start by searching for \"Linda Hamilton\" to find her page.\n\nOnce I get the page, I need to check if there's any mention of her twin sister. The user mentioned she has a twin, so the answer should be someone else's name. But how to find that?\n\nLooking at the structure of Wikipedia pages, sometimes twin information is listed under personal details. Maybe there's a section like \"Twin sister\" or something similar. Alternatively, maybe the page mentions her family members.\n\nI'll use the search_pages function with \"Linda Hamilton\" to get the page details. Then, I'll check the sections to find any relevant information. If the page doesn't mention a twin sister, I might need to look for other sources or different queries.\n\nWait, the user said Linda Hamilton has a twin sister. So there must be some information. Let me try to find that.\n\nIf the search_pages returns a page, I can read the entire content to check for any mention of her twin. If not found, maybe try searching for her twin's name directly. But that might be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the twin sister's name is listed in the same page. For example, if the page has a section like \"Family\" or \"Personal life\", maybe there's a mention.\n\nLet me proceed step by step. First, search for Linda Hamilton's page. Then check the sections. If no twin info, try different queries or sections.\n\nLet me write the code to search for Linda Hamilton's page and then check the sections.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Linda Hamilton's Wikipedia page\npages = search_pages(\"Linda Hamilton\")\nif pages:\n    # Check if the page has a twin sister section\n    sections = view_sections(pages[0]['page_id'])\n    for section in sections:\n        if section['section_name'] == 'Twin sister':\n            twin_name = read_section(pages[0]['page_id'] + \":full\")\n            print(f\"=== Twin sister of Linda Hamilton ===\")\n            print(twin_name)\n            break\n    else:\n        # If no twin sister section, check for family details\n        content = read_section(pages[0]['page_id'] + \":full\")\n        if \"t"

          "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking about Linda Hamilton's twin sister's name. I need to find that information using the Wikipedia search functions.\n\nFirst, I'll start by searching for Linda Hamilton's Wikipedia page. The code uses the search_pages function with the query \"Linda Hamilton\". If there's a result, I'll get the page ID and then check the sections.\n\nNext, I need to look for a section titled \"Twin sister\" in that page. If such a section exists, the twin's name should be listed there. If not, I'll check the entire page content for any mentions of her twin sister.\n\nIn the previous attempt, the code tried to find the \"Twin sister\" section. If that's not found, it would then read the entire page content. But in the user's final turn, they provided a partial answer. Wait, the user's code was interrupted, so I need to continue from where it left off.\n\nThe code checks if the page has a \"Twin sister\" section. If not, it tries to find any mention of her twin sister in the content. But the user's code might not have completed checking all possibilities. Let me think about possible scenarios.\n\nLinda Hamilton is known for her role in \"The Matrix\", and she has a twin sister named Natalie. But I need to confirm this through the search functions. The code should look for any mention of her twin sister in the page content. If the \"Twin sister\" section isn't found, the code would check the entire page.\n\nSo, in the code, after checking the sections, if no twin sister section is found, it would read the entire page content and look for any mention of her twin. If the code finds \"Natalie\" in the content, that's the answer. Otherwise, it might not find it and return \"Answer not found\".\n\nBut since the user's code is incomplete, I need to make sure that the code covers all possibilities. The final answer should be based on the information retrieved from the Wikipedia pages.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Linda Hamilton's Wikipedia page\npages = search_pages(\"Linda Hamilton\")\nif pages:\n    # Check if the page has a twin sister section\n    sections = view_sections(pages[0]['page_id'])\n    for section in sections:\n        if section['section_name'] == 'Twin sister':\n            twin_name = read_section(pages[0]['page_id'] + \":full\")\n            print"
