Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

          "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for one type of list related to media franchises that's mentioned alongside the highest-grossing media franchises list. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out what lists are commonly associated with media franchises. The highest-grossing list is a well-known one, like the \"Top 20 Highest-Grossing Movies of All Time\" or similar. Other lists might include things like \"Top 10 Media Franchises by Revenue,\" \"Best Media Franchise of All Time,\" or maybe something like \"Top 10 Most Expensive Movies.\"\n\nSince the question mentions a list that's mentioned alongside the highest-grossing list, I should look for lists that are often compared or referenced in the same context. For example, there's a list called \"The 100 Greatest Movies of All Time,\" which is sometimes compared to the highest-grossing list. But I need to confirm if that's actually mentioned alongside.\n\nAlternatively, there might be a list of \"Most Expensive Movies\" or \"Top 10 Media Franchises by Revenue.\" Another possibility is a list of \"Most Popular Media Franchises\" or \"Top 10 Bestselling Video Games.\" \n\nTo find this, I should search for pages related to media franchises and look for lists that are mentioned in the same context as the highest-grossing list. The user wants one specific type, so maybe something like \"Top 10 Media Franchises by Revenue\" or \"Top 10 Most Expensive Movies.\"\n\nI'll start by searching for the highest-grossing media franchises list. Then, check if any other lists are mentioned in the same context. For example, if I find a page about \"Top 20 Highest-Grossing Movies,\" maybe there's a section discussing other lists like \"Top 10 Media Franchises by Revenue.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is \"Top 10 Most Expensive Movies\" or something similar. Let me try to code this.\n\nFirst, I'll use the search_pages function with \"Top 20 Highest-Grossing Movies\" to get the relevant pages. Then, check if any other lists are mentioned in the same context. If I find a list like \"Top 10 Media Franchises by Revenue,\" that would be the answer.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for pages related to highest-grossing media franchises\nhighest_grossing = search_pages(\"Top "

          "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the answer. The question is asking for one type of list related to media franchises that's mentioned alongside the highest-grossing media franchises list.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what media franchises are. Media franchises are series of related works, like movies, TV shows, books, etc., all part of the same brand. The highest-grossing media franchises list would be a ranking of these franchises based on their total box office revenue.\n\nNow, the question is about another list that's mentioned alongside this. So, maybe there's a secondary list that's commonly associated with media franchises. For example, sometimes lists like \"Top 10 Media Franchises by Revenue\" or \"Media Franchise Categories\" might be mentioned.\n\nBut I need to confirm. Let me think of possible lists related to media franchises. There's the \"Top 10 Media Franchises by Revenue\" list, which is a common one. Another could be the \"Best Media Franchises of All Time,\" but that's more of a subjective list. Alternatively, there's the \"Media Franchise Categories\" list, which categorizes franchises into types like action, sci-fi, etc.\n\nWait, the question says \"mentioned alongside the highest-grossing media franchises list.\" So maybe the answer is a list that's often paired with the highest-grossing one. For example, in some contexts, both lists are presented together in a report or article. The most common one I can think of is the \"Top 10 Media Franchises by Revenue\" list, which is often listed alongside the highest-grossing list. Another possibility is \"Media Franchise Categories,\" but I'm not sure if that's a standard list.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is \"Media Franchise Revenue Rankings\" or something similar. But I need to make sure. Since the user wants one type of list, and given that the highest-grossing list is a ranking, another common list might be the \"Top 10 Media Franchises by Revenue\" list. However, I should check if there's a more specific term.\n\nWait, in some contexts, the \"Top 10 Media Franchises by Revenue\" is a list that's often mentioned alongside the highest-grossing list. So, the answer could be that. But I need to make sure there's no other more accurate term.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Media Franchise Categories\" is the answer. But I'm not sure"
