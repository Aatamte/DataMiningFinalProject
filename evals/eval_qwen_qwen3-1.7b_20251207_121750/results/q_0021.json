Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London.

If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

Let's start by searching for his name on Wikipedia.\n\nFirst, I'll use the search_pages function with the query \"George Reeves\". The result should give me the relevant pages. Let's see what the first result is. The title might be something like \"George Reeves (actor)\" or similar.\n\nOnce I get the page_id, I can use read_section to get the entire content. Then, I need to look for information about his burial place. The key here is to find a section that mentions his interment.\n\nIf the initial search returns a page with the correct information, I can extract the details. If not, maybe there's another page or a different section. I should check if there are any sections related to his death or burial.\n\nLet me write the code step by step. First, search for George Reeves. Then, check the sections of the page to find the burial location. If the direct answer is not there, perhaps looking for related keywords like \"burial\" or \"interment\" in the content.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't miss any possible sections. If the first result doesn't have the answer, maybe I should try a different approach, like searching for his death date or other related terms. But since the user wants the answer in two turns, I have to be efficient.\n\nLet me proceed with the first search and then check the sections.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for George Reeves on Wikipedia\npages = search_pages(\"George Reeves\")\nif pages:\n    page_id = pages[0]['page_id']\n    content = read_section(page_id + \":full\")\n    # Look for burial information in the content\n    if \"interred\" in content.lower():\n        print(f\"\\n=== George Reeves ===\")\n        print(content[content.lower().index(\"interred\") - 200:content.lower().index(\"interred\") + 300])\n    else:\n        print(\"Answer not found\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Answer not found\")\n</python>"

Then, I read the full content of that page using read_section.\n\nLooking at the content, I checked if \"interred\" is present. The code found it and tried to extract the surrounding text. The output showed that Reeves is interred at Mountain View Cemetery in Altadena, California. The text also mentions the cemetery's name and location. \n\nWait, the output has some links and other information, but the key part is the cemetery location. The answer should be Mountain View Cemetery in Altadena, California. The code correctly captured that part. Even though there's some extra text, the main answer is there.
