Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London.

If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

Let me start by searching for his birthplace.\n\nFirst, I'll use the search_pages function with the query \"Johnny Galecki birth place\". That should give me some results. Let's see what pages are returned.\n\nOnce I get the page IDs, I can use view_sections to check if there's a section about his birthplace. Maybe the page has a section titled something like \"Birth\" or \"Early Life\". If there's a section, I can read the entire content to find the answer.\n\nIf the search returns multiple pages, I need to check each one. If the first result doesn't have the information, I'll try the next. Also, maybe the answer is in a different section of the same page. Let me check the sections first.\n\nIf the sections don't directly mention the city, I might need to look for keywords like \"Belgium\" or \"city\" in the content. If the page is long, I can use context before and after to find the exact sentence.\n\nWait, the user mentioned using Python code with the functions provided. So I need to write code that does these steps. Let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Search for Johnny Galecki's birth place.\n2. Check the first result's sections to find the relevant information.\n3. If not found, try another page or check the content for the answer.\n\nLet me write the code. First, search for the film or person, then check sections. If the first result's sections don't have it, maybe the next one does. Alternatively, look for the birthplace in the content.\n\nI should also consider that the answer might be in a different section, so I need to loop through all sections. If the content is too long, use context before and after to capture the exact sentence.\n\nLet me try the code step by step.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Johnny Galecki's birthplace\nresults = search_pages(\"Johnny Galecki birth place\")\nif not results:\n    print(\"No results found.

I need to find that information using the provided functions.\n\nFirst, I'll start by searching for \"Johnny Galecki birth place\" to get the relevant pages. If there are no results, I'll try a different query. But in the previous attempt, the search returned some results. \n\nNext, I need to check the sections of the first result. The user mentioned using view_sections() to find specific sections, so I should look for a section named \"birth\" or similar. Once I find that section, I'll read the entire content to extract the birthplace.\n\nWait, the code in the previous attempt was cut off. Let me think about how to structure this. The initial code searches for the birthplace and then checks sections. If the first result has a \"birth\" section, I can read the content there. If not, maybe check other sections or try different queries.\n\nSince the user is in the final turn, I need to make sure to extract the answer correctly. If the code isn't finding the birthplace, maybe there's a different approach, like searching for \"Johnny Galecki\" directly or checking his biography. But according to the functions available, I should stick to the provided methods.\n\nI'll proceed by assuming that the first result has the birth section. The code should read the content, look for the birthplace, and extract it. If not found, maybe try another query, but since the user is in the final turn, I need to provide an answer based on the available data.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Johnny Galecki's birthplace\nresults = search_pages(\"Johnny Galecki birth place\")\nif not results:\n    print(\"No results found.
