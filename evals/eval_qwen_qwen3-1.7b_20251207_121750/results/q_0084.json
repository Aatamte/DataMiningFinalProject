Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

The user mentioned using Python code with the functions provided.\n\nFirst, I'll use the search_pages function with the query \"Zac Efron\" to find relevant pages. Let's see what results come back. If there's a page about him, I can read the full content to find his birthplace.\n\nIf the search returns a page, I'll use read_section with the page_id + \":full\" to get the entire content. Then, I'll look for mentions of his upbringing. Common keywords might be \"grew up\", \"born\", or \"family\". \n\nIf the initial search doesn't find immediate results, maybe I need to check related pages or sections. For example, if there's a section about his early life or family background. I can use view_sections to check if there's a specific section that contains the information.\n\nI should also consider using regex to extract any mentions of his hometown. But first, I need to get the full content from the page. Let me try the first step: searching for Zac Efron.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Zac Efron's pages\nresults = search_pages(\"Zac Efron\")\nif results:\n    page_id = results[0]['page_id']\n    content = read_section(page_id + \":full\")\n    # Look for \"grew up\" or \"born\" keywords\n    idx = content.lower().find(\"grew up\")\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== Zac Efron ===\")\n        print(content[max(0, idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n    else:\n        idx = content.lower().find(\"born\")\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"=== Zac Efron ===\")\n            print(content[max(0, idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\nelse:\n    print(\"Answer not found\")\n</python>"

But there was an error because CONTEXT_BEFORE wasn't defined. Oh right, the user mentioned that in the rules, if the search returns empty, try different keywords. So maybe the initial approach wasn't finding the answer.\n\nLet me think. The error was about CONTEXT_BEFORE not being defined. So maybe the code tried to access content[max(0, idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER], but CONTEXT_BEFORE wasn't defined. So perhaps the code should use a default value or remove that part. Alternatively, maybe the code should just print the relevant section without the context.\n\nWait, in the initial example, they used CONTEXT_BEFORE and CONTEXT_AFTER to limit the output. But if the code is not finding anything, maybe the problem is that the search didn't find the right page. Let me check the code again.\n\nThe code first searches for \"Zac Efron\" and gets the first result. Then it reads the full content. Then it looks for \"grew up\" or \"born\". If either is found, it prints the relevant section. But if neither is found, it prints \"Answer not found\".\n\nBut maybe the problem is that the search for \"Zac Efron\" didn't return any results. Let me think: Zac Efron is a well-known actor, so his page should exist. Maybe the search_pages function isn't returning the correct results. Alternatively, maybe the code is missing some keywords.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should look for \"grew up\" or \"born\" in the content. Let me adjust the code to handle that. Also, the error was about CONTEXT_BEFORE not being defined. So maybe the code should remove those variables or use a default value.\n\nWait, in the initial code, they had CONTEXT_BEFORE and CONTEXT_AFTER as constants. But in the error message, it's not defined. So maybe the code should be adjusted to not use those variables. Alternatively, perhaps the code should just print the content around the keyword.\n\nLet me try modifying the code to avoid using CONTEXT_BEFORE and CONTEXT_AFTER. So, instead of slicing the content with those values, just print the relevant part. For example, if \"grew up\" is found, print the content from the start until that keyword. Or maybe just print the entire section where the keyword is found.\n\nSo,"
