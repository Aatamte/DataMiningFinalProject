Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

The user is asking which game developer published the \"Made in Abyss\" role-playing game released in September 2022. \n\nFirst, I need to find information about \"Made in Abyss\" and its publisher. Since I can't browse the web, I'll have to use the functions provided: search_pages, view_sections, and read_section.\n\nStarting with the initial search. The query should be \"Made in Abyss role-playing game\". Using search_pages with this query might return the page where the game is mentioned. Let's see.\n\nIf the search returns a page, I'll need to read the entire content to find the publisher. The user mentioned that the game was released in September 2022, so maybe the page has information about the release date and publisher.\n\nIf the initial search doesn't find the game, I might need to try different keywords or look for related terms. For example, maybe the game's title is slightly different, or the publisher is mentioned in a section.\n\nOnce I have the page content, I'll check for any mentions of the publisher. The user wants the name of the developer, so the answer should be the company or individual responsible for publishing it.\n\nIf the search doesn't find the game, I'll have to conclude that the answer isn't found. But since the user expects an answer, I need to make sure I check thoroughly.\n\nLet me try the first step: search for \"Made in Abyss role-playing game\" to find the relevant page.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for the game and its publisher\nresults = search_pages(\"Made in Abyss role-playing game\")\nif results:\n    page_id = results[0]['page_id']\n    content = read_section(page_id + \":full\")\n    if \"published by\" in content.lower():\n        print(f\"=== {results[0]['title']} ===\")\n        print(content.lower().find(\"published by\"))\n    elif \"developer\" in content.lower():\n        print(f\"=== {results[0]['title']} ===\")\n        print(content.lower().find(\"developer\"))\nelse:\n    print(\"Game not found.\")\n</python>"

The user is asking which game developer published the Made in Abyss role-playing game released in September 2022. \n\nFirst, I need to find the information about Made in Abyss. The user tried a Python script that searches for the game using search_pages with the query \"Made in Abyss role-playing game\". The result was a page_id of 2815, and the content was printed. The code then checks if \"published by\" is in the content. \n\nThe output from the script shows that the content starts with \"2815\" and then the rest of the text. The code uses find() to locate \"published by\" in the content. However, the output shows the index 2815, which might be a mistake. The actual content might not contain \"published by\" directly. \n\nThe user's code then checks if \"developer\" is in the content. The output doesn't show that, but maybe the content has a section where the developer is mentioned. The code might need to look for \"developer\" or other keywords like \"publisher\" or \"company\". \n\nSince the initial code didn't find \"published by\" and then checked for \"developer\", but the output doesn't show the answer, perhaps the developer's name is mentioned in another part of the content. The user might need to search for \"Made in Abyss\" and look for sections related to the publisher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the developer's name is in the section title or a specific part of the content. The code could be adjusted to look for the developer's name directly. But given the constraints, the initial code might not have found the answer. \n\nSince the user's script didn't find the answer, but the output shows the index 2815, which might be a mistake, perhaps the correct answer is the developer mentioned in the content. However, without seeing the actual content, it's hard to tell. But based on the code's output, the answer might be the developer listed in the content. \n\nWait, the user's code printed \"2815\" as the index, which might be a mistake. The actual content might have the developer's name in the text. For example, if the content says \"Developed by [Name], published by [Publisher]\", then the code would need to extract that. But the code as written only checks for \"published by\" and \"developer\". \n\nSince the user's script didn't find"
