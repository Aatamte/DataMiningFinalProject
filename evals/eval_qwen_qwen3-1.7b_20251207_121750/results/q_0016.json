Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

Let me start by searching for her education.\n\nFirst, I'll use the search_pages function with \"Kate Box\" as the query. The goal is to find pages related to her. Let's see what results we get. If there's a page about her, I can read the full content to find her graduation year.\n\nIf the initial search doesn't return anything, maybe I need to check different keywords or look for related terms. For example, maybe she's associated with a specific program or event. But since the question is about graduation year, I should focus on educational details.\n\nOnce I find the relevant page, I'll use read_section to get the full content. Then, I need to look for mentions of her graduation from the National Institute of Dramatic Art. The key here is to check if the page contains information about her education, specifically the year she graduated.\n\nIf the search returns a page with that information, I can extract the year. If not, maybe there's another approach. But since I have two turns, I should try to get the answer in the first turn.\n\nLet me write the code step by step. First, search for Kate Box, then check the results. If a page is found, read its content and look for the graduation year. If not, try another query or section.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Kate Box and related pages\nresults = search_pages(\"Kate Box\")\nif results:\n    # Check the first result for graduation info\n    page_id = results[0]['page_id']\n    content = read_section(page_id + \":full\")\n    if \"National Institute of Dramatic Art\" in content:\n        # Look for graduation year (case-insensitive)\n        year_start = content.lower().find(\"graduated\")\n        if year_start != -1:\n            print(f\"=== {results[0]['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0, year_start + len(\"graduated\") - 10):year_start + len(\"graduated\") + 5])\n        else:\n            print(\"Graduation year not found in this result.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No education info found in the first result.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No pages found for Kate Box.\")\n</python>"

The user is asking about the year Kate Box graduated from the National Institute of Dramatic Art. \n\nFirst, I tried searching for \"Kate Box\" using the search_pages function. The results came back, and the first result is the page titled \"Kate Box\". Then I used read_section on that page to get the full content. \n\nI checked if \"National Institute of Dramatic Art\" is in the content. It was there, but the graduation year wasn't found immediately. The code looked for \"graduated\" and tried to extract the year around that term. However, the output showed \" graduated from\" which is incomplete. \n\nHmm, maybe the graduation year is mentioned in a different part of the text. The code might need to look for keywords like \"graduated\" or \"year\" nearby. Alternatively, the year could be mentioned in a section that's not captured by the initial search. \n\nSince the code didn't find the exact year in the first result, I need to check if there are other sections or pages. Maybe there's another part of the content that mentions the graduation year. But given the constraints of the tool, I can only check the first result. \n\nWait, maybe the year is in a different section. Let me think: the code uses view_sections to check if there are sections related to education. If the page has a section titled \"Education\" or similar, that might contain the info. But in the previous attempt, the code didn't find any sections. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the year is mentioned in a different part of the content, like after \"graduated from\" but not captured by the initial search. The code's current approach might be too restrictive. \n\nSince the user is asking for the answer and the initial search didn't find it, but the code can only check the first result, perhaps the answer is in a different part. But without more data, I have to rely on what's available. \n\nWait, the output from the code shows \" graduated from\" which is incomplete. Maybe the actual year is after that, but the code didn't capture it. For example, if the content says \" graduated from the National Institute of Dramatic Art in 2015\", then the code would need to parse that. But the current output is just \" graduated from\". \n\nGiven that, maybe the answer isn't found in the first result. But the user expects an answer. Since the code couldn't find it, but"
