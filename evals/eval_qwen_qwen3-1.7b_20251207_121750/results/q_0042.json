Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London.

The Hachiman kami is a Shinto deity, and the question is about identifying the head shrine (i.e., the main or primary shrines) of this deity. So, I need to find out which Shinto shrine is considered the head shrine for Hachiman.\n\nI remember that in Shinto, there are various shrines and kami (deities), and sometimes a shrine is considered the head shrine of a particular deity. For example, Hachiman is a major deity in Shinto, and there are several shrines associated with him. The head shrine would be the main or primary one.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact details. So, the approach would be to search for information on Hachiman kami and his associated shrines. The user mentioned using Python code with the functions provided, so I need to use the search_pages and read_section functions.\n\nFirst, I should search for pages related to Hachiman kami. Maybe starting with \"Hachiman kami\" or \"Shinto Hachiman shrine\". Then, once I find the relevant page, I can read its content to find information about the head shrine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe searching for \"head shrine of Hachiman kami\" could directly give the answer. But since I can't be sure, perhaps starting with a general search for Hachiman and then looking into the sections.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Use search_pages with \"Hachiman kami\" to find relevant pages.\n2. Once a page is found, use view_sections to check if there's a section about the head shrine.\n3. If the page has sections, read the relevant part and extract the answer.\n\nBut since I have only two turns, I need to do this efficiently. Let's try the first step.\n\nFirst, let's write code to search for pages related to Hachiman kami. The code would use the search_pages function with the query \"Hachiman kami\". Then, we can check the results.\n\nIf the search returns a page, then we need to read its full content. Then, look for sections that discuss the head shrine of Hachiman.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the page has a section titled \"Head Shrine\" or something similar. If not, perhaps looking for mentions of the main shrine.\n\nAnother approach: The head shrine of H"
