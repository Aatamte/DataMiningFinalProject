Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

The user is asking about a company that Hayden Christensen co-founded with his brother to produce micro-budget films. \n\nFirst, I need to find information about Hayden Christensen and his co-founders. Since the question is about a company he co-founded, I should look for mentions of companies related to micro-budget films. \n\nI'll start by searching for \"Hayden Christensen\" on Wikipedia. The search should return pages about him. Let's see what the first result looks like. The page might have sections about his career, including any companies he founded.\n\nOnce I get the page, I need to check if there's a section about co-founded companies. Maybe there's a \"Companies\" or \"Career\" section. If the page is large, using view_sections() could help narrow down relevant parts.\n\nIf the main page doesn't have the answer, I might need to look into sections or subpages. For example, if there's a section about his brother, that might mention the company. Alternatively, maybe there's a direct mention of the company name in the content.\n\nAnother approach is to check if the company name is mentioned in the context of micro-budget films. The answer might be a specific company like \"MicroMachines\" or something similar, but I need to confirm.\n\nLet me write the code to search for Hayden Christensen's page. Then, check the sections and content for any mentions of co-founded companies. If the company name is found, that's the answer. If not, try different queries or sections.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Hayden Christensen's page\nhayden_page = search_pages(\"Hayden Christensen\")[0]\ncontent = read_section(hayden_page['page_id'] + \":full\")\n\n# Check for company mentions in the main page\nif \"co-founded\" in content.lower():\n    print(\"=== Company Mentioned ===\")\n    print(content.lower().find(\"co-founded\"))\nelse:\n    # Search for sections related to his brother\n    brother_section = view_sections(hayden_page['page_id'])[:3]\n    for section in brother_section:\n        if \"brother\" in section['section_name'].lower():\n            content = read_section(section['page_id'] + \":full\")\n            if \"company\" in content.lower():\n                print(\"=== Company Found ===\")\n                print(content.lower().find(\"company\"))\n</python>"

The user is asking about the company Hayden Christensen co-founded with his brother to produce micro-budget films. \n\nFirst, I need to find Hayden Christensen's page. The initial code searches for \"Hayden Christensen\" and takes the first result. Then it reads the full content of that page. The code checks if \"co-founded\" is in the content, but the output was empty. So, maybe the company mention isn't there.\n\nThen, the code searches for sections related to his brother. It views the sections of the Hayden Christensen page and checks the first three sections. If any of those sections mention \"brother\", it reads the content and looks for \"company\". The output was empty again.\n\nHmm, maybe the company isn't mentioned in the main page or the sections related to his brother. But the user is expecting an answer. Let me think of other possibilities. Maybe the company name is mentioned in a different part of the page, or perhaps the brother's section has more details. \n\nWait, maybe the brother's section is not the first three, but another part. Or perhaps the company name is in a different context. Let me try to think of micro-budget films companies. Companies like The Microbudget Film Company, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a specific company named in the content.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code needs to look for keywords like \"micro-budget\" or \"film production\" in the content. The original code only checked for \"co-founded\" and \"company\", but maybe there are other keywords. \n\nWait, the initial code checks if \"co-founded\" is in the content. If not, it searches for sections with \"brother\" and then looks for \"company\". But the output was empty. So maybe the company isn't there. But the user is expecting an answer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the brother's section has more details. Let me check the code again. The code views the first three sections of Hayden Christensen's page. If any of those sections mention \"brother\", it reads the content and looks for \"company\". But if the brother's section isn't there, maybe the code misses it. \n\nWait, maybe the brother's section is not in the first three, but later. Or perhaps the code isn't finding the right sections. Alternatively, maybe the company name is in a different part of the content. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is \"Microbudget Films\" or another name."
