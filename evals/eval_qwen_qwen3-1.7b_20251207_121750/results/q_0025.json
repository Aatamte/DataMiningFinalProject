Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

The user is asking which notable Italian political figure is associated with the Doris family business network. \n\nFirst, I need to find information about the Doris family. The Doris family is a well-known Italian family with a significant business network, particularly in the food and beverage industry. They are involved in various sectors, including restaurants and confectionery.\n\nSince the question is about a political figure associated with them, I should look for any political figures who have connections to the Doris family. The Doris family has been involved in politics, especially in Italy. \n\nI'll start by searching for the Doris family's business network. Using the search_pages function with the query \"Doris family business network\" might help find relevant pages. Then, I can check if any of those pages mention political figures.\n\nIf the search returns a page about the Doris family, I need to look for sections that discuss their political involvement. The user mentioned using view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages, so maybe there's a section titled something like \"Political Involvement\" or \"Family Members.\"\n\nOnce I find the relevant sections, I can read the content and look for mentions of political figures. For example, there might be a section about the family's business and their connections to politicians.\n\nIf the search doesn't directly find the answer, I might need to try different queries or look for other related terms. For instance, searching for \"Doris family politics\" or \"Doris business network politicians.\"\n\nAnother approach is to check if the Doris family has any notable members in Italian politics. The family's name is associated with the Doria family, which has a long history in Italy. However, the Doris family is a different entity, but perhaps they have connections through other branches.\n\nI should also consider the possibility that the answer is a member of the Doria family, but since the question specifically mentions the Doris family, I need to stick to that.\n\nIn code terms, I'll first search for the Doris family business network. If that doesn't yield results, I'll try a different query. Then, I'll look for sections in the pages that mention political figures. If found, I'll extract the name and present it as the answer.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Doris family business network\npages = search_pages(\"Doris family business network\")\nif pages:\n    # Check if any page mentions political figures\n    for page in pages"

The user is asking which notable Italian political figure is associated with the Doris family business network.\n\nFirst, I need to find information about the Doris family and their business network. The user mentioned using Python code with the functions provided. So, I'll start by searching for \"Doris family business network\" to get relevant pages.\n\nLooking at the search results, I need to check each page to see if they mention any political figures. The first page might have some information. Let me check the content of that page. If it doesn't mention a political figure, I'll need to look elsewhere.\n\nIf the initial search doesn't find anything, I might need to use different keywords or check other sections. Maybe the Doris family has a specific business network in Italy, and their connections to politics are notable. I should look for terms like \"political figure\" or \"politician\" in the content.\n\nAnother approach is to search for the Doris family's business network and then check if any of their members are politicians. If the search returns multiple pages, I'll need to parse each one carefully. If none of the pages mention a political figure, then the answer might be that it's not found.\n\nWait, the user said to use Python code in the first turn. But in the previous interaction, the assistant tried searching and found that the Doris family business network was mentioned. However, in the final turn, the assistant needs to provide the answer now.\n\nIn the previous attempt, the code searched for \"Doris family business network\" and then checked each page. If the first page had a mention of a political figure, that would be the answer. If not, then the assistant might need to look for other pages or different keywords.\n\nSince the user is in the final turn, I need to make sure that the code is correctly structured. The assistant should check each page, look for political figures, and extract the answer. If no answer is found, then output \"Answer not found\".\n\nSo, the code should search for the Doris family business network, check each page's content for political figures, and then present the answer. If none are found, the final answer would be \"Answer not found\".\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Doris family business network\npages = search_pages(\"Doris family business network\")\nif pages:\n    # Check if any page mentions political figures\n    for page in pages:\n        content = read_section(page['"
