Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

Let's start by figuring out the steps.\n\nFirst, I should search for the 2022 Best Picture winner. The Oscars usually have a list of winners, so maybe searching for \"2022 Academy Award Best Picture\" would give me the relevant information. Once I get the list, I can check each winner's details.\n\nNext, I need to find out which of those winners used Adobe Premiere Pro for their editing. The problem mentions that the answer might be in the details of the film's production or technical information. So, perhaps looking for sections like \"Editing\" or \"Production\" in the film's page.\n\nI'll start by using the search_pages function with the query \"2022 Academy Award Best Picture\" to get a list of films. Then, for each film, I'll read the full content to check for any information about editing software. If a film's page mentions Adobe Premiere Pro, that's the answer.\n\nWait, but how do I know which film is the 2022 winner? The 2022 Oscars were awarded in 2023, so the film must have been released in 2022. Let me check the actual list. The 2022 Best Picture winner was \"Promising Young Wanderers\" (also known as \"Wanderers\"), directed by Haim Samuel. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe it's \"The Power of the Dog\" or another film.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should search for the 2022 Best Picture winner first. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, use search_pages with the query \"2022 Academy Award Best Picture\" to get the list of films. Then, for each film in that list, read their full content and check for Adobe Premiere Pro.\n\nBut since I can only do two turns, I need to be efficient. Let's try the first part: search for the 2022 Best Picture winner.\n\nIf the search returns a list of films, I can take the first one (assuming it's the winner) and check if it uses Adobe Premiere Pro. If not, try the next.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a specific film that is known for using Adobe Premiere Pro. For example, \"The Power of the Dog\" was edited with Adobe Premiere Pro.
