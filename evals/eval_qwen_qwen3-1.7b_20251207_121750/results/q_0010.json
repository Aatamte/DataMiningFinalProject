Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

Once I locate the correct section, I'll read its content to find the character's name. \n\nIf the search doesn't find the show or the character, I'll need to try different queries or check other related pages.

The initial code didn't find the character, so maybe the problem is in how the search was conducted. Let me think about possible mistakes.\n\nThe user used search_pages with the show title, but maybe the exact title is different. Wait, the show is sometimes referred to as \"The Haves and the Have Nots\" but maybe there's a different name. Alternatively, perhaps the character isn't in the main episode list but in a specific episode or a different context.\n\nThe code checked sections of the page, but maybe the section containing 'The Ice Queen' isn't in the first few sections. Or perhaps the character is mentioned in a different part of the page, like a sub-section or a specific episode.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the user should search for the character's name directly. Let me try changing the query to look for 'The Ice Queen' in the show's pages. Also, maybe the show's title has a different spelling or is part of the page title.\n\nWait, in the initial code, the user checked if the page title contains the show name. But maybe the character's name is part of the page title. For example, if the page is titled \"The Haves and the Have Nots: The Ice Queen\", then the section might be there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the character is mentioned in a specific episode. Let me try searching for 'The Ice Queen' in the show's pages, and check if any sections mention her. Also, maybe the code should look for the character's name in the entire content, not just sections.\n\nWait, the user's code uses view_sections to check each section. But maybe the section containing 'The Ice Queen' is in a different part of the page, like a specific episode or a sub-section. Let me adjust the code to search for the character's name in the entire content, not just sections. Also, maybe the show's title is different, like \"The Haves and the Have Nots\" vs. \"The Haves and the Have-Nots\".\n\nAnother possibility: the user might need to search for the character's name in the show's episodes. Let me try modifying the code to look for 'The Ice Queen' in the entire content of the pages. Also, perhaps the show's title is miss"
