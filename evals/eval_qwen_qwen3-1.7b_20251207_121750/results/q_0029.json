Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

First, I need to find out who Ally Wernick is and what role she plays in \"Dave.\"\n\nI'll start by searching for the series \"Dave\" to find any mentions of Ally Wernick. Using the search_pages function with the query \"Dave\" might give me some pages. Then, I'll check each page to see if Ally Wernick is mentioned.\n\nOnce I find the relevant page, I need to read the entire content to look for her character's profession. The user mentioned using the read_section function with the page_id + \":full\" to get the full content. So, I'll use that to extract the details.\n\nIf the initial search doesn't find anything, I might need to try different keywords or look into sections of the page. Maybe there's a specific section about characters in \"Dave\" that I can view using view_sections. But since the user has only two turns, I need to be efficient.\n\nLet me write the code step by step. First, search for \"Dave\" to get the page IDs. Then, read the full content of the first result and search for \"Ally Wernick\" using the find method. If found, extract the profession from the context. If not, try another approach, maybe search for her name in different sections or use a different query.\n\nWait, the user might have to check multiple pages. So in the first turn, I'll search for \"Dave\" and then look for Ally Wernick. If that doesn't work, I'll try another query in the same script. But since the user has only two turns, I need to make sure I don't go over.\n\nLet me outline the code:\n\n1. Search for \"Dave\" to get the page ID.\n2. Read the full content of that page.\n3. Search for \"Ally Wernick\" in the content to find her character's profession.\n\nIf that doesn't work, maybe search for \"Ally Wernick\" in the same page or look for other related terms. But given the constraints, I'll proceed with this approach.\n\nI need to make sure that the code is structured correctly. Also, using the read_section function with the page_id + \":full\" to get the entire content. Then, using string methods like find to locate the relevant parts.\n\nIf the code finds the profession, then the answer is"
