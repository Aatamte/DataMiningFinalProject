Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London.

If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

Let me start by figuring out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should search for Showtime's original series that premiered on August 16, 2010. The user mentioned \"Showtime original series,\" so I should look for TV shows that were originally produced by Showtime and aired on that date. \n\nI can use the search_pages function with the query \"Showtime original series premiere August 16, 2010\" to find relevant pages. Then, I need to check each of those pages to see which one had the largest audience. But how do I get the audience numbers? The problem is that the data might not be directly available in the pages. Maybe the audience figures are mentioned in the description or in a section like \"Premiere Audience\" or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the audience numbers are part of the show's details. Let me think. If I can find the page for each Showtime original series that premiered on August 16, 2010, then I can look for any mention of audience numbers. For example, the page might have a section like \"Premiere Audience\" or \"Viewership\" where the numbers are listed.\n\nSo, step 1: Search for Showtime original series that premiered on August 16, 2010. Use the search_pages function with the query \"Showtime original series premiere August 16, 2010\". Let's assume the first result is the relevant page. Then, read the entire content of that page to check for audience numbers.\n\nIf the page doesn't have direct audience figures, maybe I need to look for other sections. For example, the page might mention the show's popularity or viewership in general. Alternatively, maybe there's a section like \"Audience\" or \"Viewership Statistics\".\n\nAnother approach: Check if the show's description includes the audience numbers. For instance, if the page has a section titled \"Audience\" with the number 10 million, that would be the answer. But how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the audience numbers are mentioned in a different part of the page. For example, if the show's premiere was on that date, maybe there's a section about the premiere's success. Let me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. Use search"
