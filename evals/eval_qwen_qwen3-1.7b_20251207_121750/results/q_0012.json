Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

          "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out which 1979 Atari game is credited by Brett Weiss as an early action-adventure game using multiple screens. \n\nFirst, I need to find out what games Brett Weiss is associated with. The question mentions he's credited for an early action-adventure game with multiple screens. I remember that Atari had some popular games in the 70s, like Space Invaders, but those were more classic. Maybe something from 1979?\n\nWait, the user is asking for a game that's credited by Brett Weiss. I need to check if there's any information about Brett Weiss and his games. Let me think... Brett Weiss was a game designer at Atari, right? He worked on some games like \"Asteroids\" and \"Space Invaders.\" But the question is about a 1979 game with multiple screens.\n\nHmm, maybe \"Asteroids\" was released in 1979. But I'm not sure if it's considered an action-adventure game. Alternatively, \"Tempest\" or \"Goonies\"? Wait, \"Goonies\" was a 1985 game. Maybe I'm mixing up the years.\n\nWait, the user says \"credited by Brett Weiss as an early action-adventure game utilizing multiple screens.\" So maybe the answer is a game that's known for using multiple screens, like \"Space Invaders\" but that was 1978. Or maybe a game from 1979 that's less known.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is \"Asteroids,\" which was released in 1979 and used multiple screens. But I need to verify if Brett Weiss is credited for that. Wait, Brett Weiss was involved in developing \"Asteroids\" and other games. So maybe the answer is Asteroids.\n\nBut I need to confirm. Let me think about how to approach this. The user wants the code to search Wikipedia for relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll use the search_pages function with the query \"Brett Weiss\" to find his pages. Then, look for games he's associated with. Once I find the page, I can check the sections to see if there's information about the game. Alternatively, search for \"Asteroids\" and check if it's credited to Brett Weiss.\n\nBut since the user is asking for a 1979 game, maybe I should search for \"Asteroids\" and check if it's from 1"
