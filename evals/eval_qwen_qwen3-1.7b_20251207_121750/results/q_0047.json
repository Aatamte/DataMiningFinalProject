Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

          "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for the name of the clothing brand co-founded by Pharrell and Nigo. I need to find this information using Python code and the functions provided.\n\nFirst, I should search for Pharrell's co-founders. The query might be \"Pharrell co-founded with Nigo\" or something similar. Let me start by using the search_pages function with that query.\n\nOnce I get the results, I need to check each page's content. The goal is to find the brand name. Maybe the brand is mentioned in the film or a news article about Pharrell and Nigo. \n\nIf the initial search returns a page with the brand name, I can extract it. If not, maybe I need to look for sections related to Pharrell's career or collaborations. For example, checking sections like \"Career\" or \"Collaborations\".\n\nI should also consider using regex to find the brand name in the text. The read_section function can be used to get the entire content of a page, and then search for the brand name using string methods.\n\nIf the first attempt doesn't find it, I might need to try different queries or look into other pages. But since I have only two turns, I should be efficient.\n\nLet me write the code step by step. First, search for the film or project related to Pharrell and Nigo. Then check the content for the brand name. If not found, try another approach.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Pharrell and Nigo's collaboration\nfor r in search_pages(\"Pharrell co-founded with Nigo\")[:5]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    if \"Pharrell\" in content and \"Nigo\" in content:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content.lower().find(\"brand name\") != -1)\n        break\n\n# Check for brand name in relevant sections\nif not any(\"brand name\" in content.lower() for r in search_pages(\"Pharrell career\")[:3] for content in [read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")]):\n    print(\"<answer>Answer not found</answer>\")\n</python>"
