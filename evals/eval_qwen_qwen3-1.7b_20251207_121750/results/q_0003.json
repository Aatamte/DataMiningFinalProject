Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London.

If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

The user is asking for the name of the failed Cuban army offensive against the Sierra Maestra mountains in 1958. \n\nFirst, I need to find information about the Sierra Maestra campaign. The user mentioned it's a failed offensive, so I should look for historical events related to Cuba in 1958. \n\nI'll start by searching Wikipedia for \"Sierra Maestra\" or \"Cuban offensive 1958\". Maybe there's a page about the Cuban War of Independence or something similar. \n\nUsing the search_pages function with \"Sierra Maestra\" might give me some results. Let's see. The first result could be a page about the campaign. Once I get that page, I can read its full content to find the name of the offensive.\n\nAlternatively, if the search returns a page about the Cuban Revolution, I might need to look for specific events. The user mentioned the Sierra Maestra mountains, so the offensive might be part of the broader Cuban conflict. \n\nOnce I have the page content, I'll check for mentions of the offensive. The name is likely a specific operation, maybe something like \"Cuban Army Offensive of 1958\" or similar. But I need to confirm it's the failed one.\n\nIf the search returns a page that doesn't directly mention the name, I might need to look for related terms. Maybe there's a section in the page that discusses the campaign's outcomes, and the failed offensive is mentioned there. \n\nI should also consider if the page has sections like \"History\" or \"Military Operations\" where the offensive is discussed. Using view_sections to check for those sections could help locate the relevant information.\n\nIf the content is not found, I might need to try different queries or look for related historical events. But given the constraints, I'll proceed with the initial search and extract the answer from the first result.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for the Cuban offensive in Sierra Maestra\noffensive = search_pages(\"Sierra Maestra Cuban offensive 1958\")[:1]\n\nif offensive:\n    page_id = offensive[0][\"page_id\"]\n    content = read_section(page_id + \":full\")\n    print(f\"=== {content[:100]} ===\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Answer not found\")\n</python>"

          "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking about the name of the failed Cuban army offensive against the Sierra Maestra mountains in 1958. \n\nFirst, I tried searching for \"Sierra Maestra Cuban offensive 1958\" using the search_pages function. The response came back as an empty list, which means there might not be a direct result. Then I checked the output from the search, which showed a page with some content but it was empty. The content starts with \"Revision ID: 1159781808 | Timestamp: 2023-06-12T14:04:00Z\" and then some markdown tables, but nothing about the offensive.\n\nSince the search didn't find any relevant pages, I need to think of alternative approaches. Maybe the offensive isn't directly mentioned in the search terms. The user might be referring to a specific event that's not covered by the initial search. \n\nI should consider possible variations in the query. Maybe using different keywords like \"failed Cuban offensive Sierra Maestra 1958\" or \"Cuban army Sierra Maestra 1958\". But since the first attempt didn't work, I need to try another angle.\n\nLooking at the content provided, there's a mention of the Cuban Revolution and some historical context. The Sierra Maestra is a mountain range in Cuba, and the offensive might be part of the larger conflict during the Cuban Revolution. However, the search results don't explicitly state the name of the offensive.\n\nSince the initial search didn't find any information, I have to conclude that the answer might not be available through the current search methods. But the user expects an answer. Maybe the offensive is known by a different name, or there's a section in the Wikipedia pages that I haven't accessed properly.\n\nWait, perhaps the user is referring to the \"Cuban Revolution\" itself. The revolution involved various offensives, but the specific one against the Sierra Maestra in 1958 might be a minor or less-known event. However, without direct information from the search, I can't confirm.\n\nGiven that the initial search didn't find any results, and the content provided is empty or not relevant, I have to state that the answer isn't found. But the user might expect a different approach. Alternatively, maybe there's a section in the Wikipedia pages that I haven't accessed correctly."
