Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

First, I need to find reliable sources that discuss this specific event.\n\nI'll start by searching for \"Assyrian genocide World War I\" to get some initial results. The first few pages might contain relevant information. Let me check the first few results using the search_pages function.\n\nOnce I find a page that discusses the Assyrian genocide, I need to read its full content. The user mentioned using the read_section function with the page_id + \":full\" to get the entire content. I'll look for mentions of the Assyrian genocide, maybe in sections like \"Background,\" \"Causes,\" or \"Effects.\"\n\nIf the initial search doesn't find a direct answer, I might need to look for related topics. For example, searching \"Assyrian genocide deaths\" or \"Assyrian genocide casualties\" could yield more specific data. If the first search returns a page with detailed information, I'll extract the relevant part.\n\nI should also check if there are any sections like \"Historical Context\" or \"Demographic Data\" that might mention the estimated deaths. If the content is too lengthy, using view_sections to find specific sections could help narrow down the information.\n\nIf I don't find a clear answer in the initial results, I'll need to try different queries or look for alternative sources. However, since the user allows only two turns, I need to be efficient. Let's proceed step by step.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for pages related to Assyrian genocide in World War I\nresults = search_pages(\"Assyrian genocide World War I\")\nif results:\n    # Extract the first relevant page\n    page_id = results[0]['page_id']\n    full_content = read_section(page_id + \":full\")\n    \n    # Search for the term \"Assyrian genocide\" in the full content\n    idx = full_content.lower().find(\"assyrian genocide\")\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {results[0]['title']} ===\")\n        print(full_content[max(0, idx - CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx + CONTEXT_AFTER])\nelse:\n    print(\"No relevant pages found.\")\n</python>"

The previous code tried to search for pages related to that topic but encountered an error because CONTEXT_BEFORE and CONTEXT_AFTER weren't defined.\n\nFirst, I need to fix that error. The code uses variables CONTEXT_BEFORE and CONTEXT_AFTER, but they aren't declared. So I should add them as constants or variables in the code. Let me adjust the code to include these variables.\n\nNext, the code searches for pages related to \"Assyrian genocide World War I\" and then extracts the first result. It then searches for the term \"assyrian genocide\" in the full content. If found, it prints the relevant section. But if there's an error, like no pages found, it informs the user.\n\nWait, in the previous attempt, the code didn't handle the error properly. The user's code had a typo with CONTEXT_BEFORE and CONTEXT_AFTER not being defined. So I need to correct that by adding them as variables.\n\nAlso, the code might not have found any relevant pages, so I should check if the results list is empty. If it's empty, output \"No relevant pages found.\" But the user's code already has that check. However, in the error message, the CODE was trying to access CONTEXT_BEFORE and CONTEXT_AFTER without defining them, which caused a NameError.\n\nSo the correct approach is to define CONTEXT_BEFORE and CONTEXT_AFTER at the start of the code. Let me rewrite the code with those variables.\n\nThen, after fixing the error, the code will search for the genocide term. If found, it'll print the relevant section. If not, it'll output the appropriate message.\n\nBut since the user's code didn't find any pages, maybe the answer is that it's not found. However, the user might have a page with the information. But given the code as written, if no pages are found, the output would be \"No relevant pages found.\" But the user might have a different scenario.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is correct and the answer isn't found. But since the user's code didn't find any, the answer would be \"Answer not found.\" However, the user might have a page with the information. But without seeing the actual data, it's hard to tell.\n\nBut according to the rules, if the code can't find the answer, output \"Answer not found.\" So in this case, since the code didn't find any"
