Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London.

Let me start by searching for Parveen Kaur's information.\n\nFirst, I'll use the search_pages function with the query \"Parveen Kaur\" to find relevant pages. Let's see what results come back. The first result might be a Wikipedia page about her. Once I get that page, I can read the entire content to find the information about her upbringing.\n\nAssuming the first result is the correct page, I'll use read_section with the page_id + \":full\" to get the full content. Then, I need to look for sections that mention her birthplace or upbringing. Common sections might be \"Biography\", \"Early life\", or \"Family\".\n\nIf the content doesn't directly mention the valley, I might need to look for related information. For example, if the page mentions her birthplace as a city, I can check if that city is in a Canadian valley. Alternatively, there might be a section about her family or hometown that specifies the valley.\n\nIf the initial search doesn't find the answer, I might need to try different queries or look for related terms like \"Parveen Kaur hometown\" or \"Parveen Kaur birthplace\". But since I have only two turns, I need to be efficient.\n\nLet me proceed step by step. First, search for Parveen Kaur's page. Then, read the full content and check for relevant sections.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Parveen Kaur's page\nresults = search_pages(\"Parveen Kaur\")\nif results:\n    page_id = results[0][\"page_id\"]\n    content = read_section(page_id + \":full\")\n    # Look for sections mentioning upbringing or hometown\n    for section in view_sections(page_id):\n        if section[\"section_name\"] == \"Biography\" or section[\"section_name\"] == \"Early life\":\n            idx = content.lower().find(\"raised in\")\n            if idx != -1:\n                print(f\"=== {section['section_name']} ===\")\n                print(content[max(0, idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n                break\nelse:\n    print(\"Answer not found\")\n</python>"

The previous code attempt had an error because CONTEXT_BEFORE and CONTEXT_AFTER weren't defined. Hmm, I need to fix that.\n\nFirst, the code searches for Parveen Kaur's page. If found, it reads the full content and looks for sections titled \"Biography\" or \"Early life\". The error was about CONTEXT_BEFORE and CONTEXT_AFTER not being defined. So I should define these variables before using them.\n\nLet me adjust the code. Define CONTEXT_BEFORE and CONTEXT_AFTER as some reasonable numbers, like 100 and 400. Then, when searching for the section, use those values to slice the content correctly. Also, make sure that the code handles the case where the section is found and prints the relevant part.\n\nWait, in the previous attempt, the code used max(0, idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE) and idx+CONTEXT_AFTER. That's correct to avoid negative indices. So the error was due to undefined variables. Fix that by adding the definitions.\n\nOnce the code runs, if it finds the section, it should print the part mentioning where she was raised. If not, output \"Answer not found\". But since the user is in the final turn, I need to make sure the code is correct and then provide the answer based on the output.\n\nI think that's all. Let me write the corrected code with the variables defined and then check if it works.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Define context limits\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Search for Parveen Kaur's page\nresults = search_pages(\"Parveen Kaur\")\nif results:\n    page_id = results[0][\"page_id\"]\n    content = read_section(page_id + \":full\")\n    # Look for sections mentioning upbringing or hometown\n    for section in view_sections(page_id):\n        if section[\"section_name\"] == \"Biography\" or section[\"section_name\"] == \"Early life\":\n            idx = content.lower().find(\"raised in\")\n            if idx != -1:\n                print(f\"=== {section['section_name']} ===\")\n                print(content[max(0, idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n                break\nelse:\n    print(\"Answer not found\")\n</python>"
