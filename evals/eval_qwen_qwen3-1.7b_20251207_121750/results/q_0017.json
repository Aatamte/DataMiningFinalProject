Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

Let me start by searching for MasterChef Australia spin-offs.\n\nFirst, I'll use the search_pages function with the query \"MasterChef Australia spin-off\". The result should give me a list of pages related to the show's spin-offs. Let's say the first result is a page titled \"MasterChef Australia: The Final\" or something similar. Then, I need to check the content of that page to see if there's information about the spin-off.\n\nOnce I have the page, I can use view_sections to look for sections that mention pastry chefs. Maybe there's a section titled \"Categories\" or \"Competitions\" where the details about the competition types are listed. If the section includes information about pastry chefs, that might be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, if the spin-off's page doesn't have that info, I might need to search for other pages related to MasterChef Australia. Maybe there's a separate page for each spin-off, and I need to check each one individually. For example, if the first spin-off is \"MasterChef Australia: The Final\", I can read its full content and look for the competition details.\n\nIf the search returns multiple pages, I should check each one. If none of them mention pastry chefs, then the answer might be something else, like \"MasterChef Australia: The Final\" or another spin-off that I haven't considered. But based on the question, it's likely a specific spin-off.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is \"MasterChef Australia: The Final\" since that's a well-known spin-off. But I need to confirm. Let me try searching for the spin-offs first.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for MasterChef Australia spin-offs\nspinoffs = search_pages(\"MasterChef Australia spin-off\")[:5]\nprint(f\"Found {len(spinoffs)} spin-offs: {spinoffs}\")\n\n# Check each spin-off's content for pastry chef info\nfor spinoff in spinoffs:\n    page_id = spinoff['page_id']\n    content = read_section(page_id + \":full\")\n    if \"pastry chefs\" in content.lower():\n        print(f\"\\n=== {spinoff['title']} ===\")\n        print(content.split(\"pastry chefs\")[1].split(\"prize\")[0])\n        break\n</python>"

Initial rounds consist of a large number of hopeful contestants from across Australia individually \"auditioning\" by presenting a food dish before the three judges in order to gain one of 50 semi-final places. Entrants must be over 18 years old and their main source of income cannot come from preparing and cooking fresh food in a professional environment.\n\nThe semi-finalists then compete in several challenges that test their food knowledge and preparation skills. In series 1, the top 50 competed until 20 were left, with the final 20 progressing to the main stage of the show. From series 2 onwards, 24 contestants progress. The contestants will then be whittled down through a number of individual and team-based cooking challenges and weekly elimination rounds until a winning MasterChef is crowned.

The user is asking which spin-off of MasterChef Australia features professional pastry chefs competing for a prize.\n\nFirst, I need to check the spin-offs listed. The initial search found five spin-offs. The first one is \"MasterChef Australia\" itself, which seems obvious. But the user wants a spin-off, so maybe the other ones are candidates.\n\nLooking at the output, the second entry is \"MasterChef _American TV series\", but that's probably a different show. The third is \"Australia national cricket team\" and the others are unrelated. So the only relevant one might be the first one, but that's the main show. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. The user is asking for a spin-off, so perhaps the answer isn't in the first list. But according to the search, the first entry is the main show, and the others are different.\n\nWait, maybe the user made a mistake in the search query. The initial code searched for \"MasterChef Australia spin-off\" and got the main show as the first result. But the question is about a spin-off, so maybe the answer is that there's no such spin-off listed here. But the user expects an answer, so perhaps the correct spin-off is \"MasterChef Australia\" itself, even though it's the main show. But the question specifies a spin-off.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another spin-off that wasn't listed in the search. But according to the given code, the search returned those five. So maybe the answer is that there's no spin-off listed here, but the user wants an answer. Alternatively, perhaps the code missed a spin-off. But given the information provided, the only possible answer is that there's no spin-off listed, but the user might expect a different approach.\n\nWait, looking back at the content of the first spin-off (MasterChef Australia), it mentions that the initial rounds have contestants auditioning, and then semi-finals. The format includes challenges with food knowledge and preparation. But the question is about a spin-off featuring pastry chefs. The content doesn't mention any specific spin-off with pastry chefs. Therefore, based on the provided data, there's no spin-off listed that fits. However, the user might expect a different answer. But according to the code's output, the only relevant entry is the main show. So the answer would be that there's no spin-off listed, but since the user requires an answer, perhaps the correct answer is that there"
