Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London.

If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

Let me start by searching for Hanna-Barbera's animated shows and check their Emmy wins.\n\nFirst, I'll use the search_pages function with the query \"Hanna-Barbera animated TV shows\" to get a list of relevant pages. Then, I'll look through each page's content to find which shows were produced by Hanna-Barbera and their Emmy Awards.\n\nWait, the user mentioned \"the first to win an Emmy Award,\" so I need to check if any of their shows won the first Emmy. Let me start by searching for Hanna-Barbera's animated TV shows. Maybe the first show they produced was The Simpsons, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe something like The Jetsons or other shows.\n\nLet me check the first few results from the search. Suppose the first result is a page about The Simpsons. Then, I'll read the full content to see if it mentions Emmy wins. If not, move to the next show.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is The Huckleberry Hound Show, but I'm not certain. Let me try to find the exact show. If the search returns multiple pages, I'll need to check each one's content.\n\nAnother approach: search for \"Hanna-Barbera Emmy Award winner\" to find specific entries. But the user wants the show name, not the award. So maybe I need to look for shows that won their first Emmy.\n\nWait, The Huckleberry Hound Show was produced by Hanna-Barbera and won its first Emmy in 1980. But I'm not sure if that's the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe The Flintstones? Or perhaps The Jetsons?\n\nI need to verify this through the code. Let me write a script that searches for Hanna-Barbera's animated shows and then checks their Emmy wins. If the first result is The Simpsons, check if it won an Emmy. If not, look for other shows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is The Jetsons, which won its first Emmy in 1984. But I need to confirm.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Hanna-Barbera animated TV shows\nSHOWS = search_pages(\"Hanna-Barbera animated TV shows\")[:5]\n\nfor show in SHOWS:\n    page_id = show['page_id']\n    content = read_section(page"

          "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which animated TV show produced by Hanna-Barbera was the first to win an Emmy Award. \n\nFirst, I need to recall which Hanna-Barbera shows won Emmys. I know that \"The Simpsons\" is a major one, but I'm not sure if it's the first. There's also \"The Jetsons\" and \"Scooby-Doo\". Wait, \"Scooby-Doo\" started in the 1960s, but I think it won an Emmy in the 70s. However, \"The Jetsons\" was a later show, maybe in the 80s or 90s. \n\nBut wait, \"The Simpsons\" started in 1989 and won its first Emmy in 2000. But I'm not sure if that's the first. Let me check. Alternatively, \"The Honeymooners\" or other shows. Wait, I think \"Scooby-Doo\" did win an Emmy in the 70s. But I need to confirm which one was the first.\n\nWait, the user is asking for the first one. So maybe \"The Honeymooners\" or \"Scooby-Doo\". But I'm not sure. Let me think. The first Emmy for an animated show might be \"The Jetsons\" in 1962, but that's a sitcom. Wait, no, \"The Jetsons\" was an animated series that aired from 1962 to 1965. It won an Emmy in 1964 for Outstanding Animated Program. But I think that was the first. However, \"The Honeymooners\" was a live action show and not animated. \n\nWait, but the user is asking about an animated TV show produced by Hanna-Barbera. So \"The Jetsons\" is an animated series, and it won the first Emmy in 1964. But I need to confirm if that's correct. Alternatively, \"Scooby-Doo\" won an Emmy in 1975. So the first would be \"The Jetsons\". \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to search for the correct answer using the provided functions. The user has already tried searching for Hanna-Barbera animated TV shows and got some results. The code was interrupted, but the user is now in the final turn. \n\nSo,"
