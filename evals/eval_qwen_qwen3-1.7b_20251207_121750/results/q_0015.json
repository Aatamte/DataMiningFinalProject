Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

The user wants to know the price per share for Accenture's initial public offering in July 2001. \n\nFirst, I need to find information about Accenture's IPO. The initial public offering (IPO) is when a company sells shares to the public for the first time. The price per share during that time would be a key figure here.\n\nI'll start by searching for \"Accenture IPO 2001 price per share\" to find relevant articles or pages. The search might return a page about Accenture's history, including their IPO details.\n\nOnce I find the relevant page, I need to check if it mentions the price per share. If the page is long, I might use view_sections() to look for specific sections like \"IPO Details\" or \"Financials\". If the price is mentioned in a section, I can read that section to get the exact figure.\n\nIf the search doesn't find the answer directly, I might need to try different keywords or look for related information. For example, checking the company's website or financial reports. However, since I can only use the provided functions, I'll stick to searching Wikipedia for the answer.\n\nLet me write a Python script to search for the IPO details. The first step is to use search_pages with the query \"Accenture IPO 2001 price per share\". If the results are empty, I'll adjust the query. Then, I'll read the full content of the first result to find the answer.\n\nIf the price is found, I'll print it. If not, I'll try another approach, maybe searching for \"Accenture IPO 2001\" and looking for financial details. The answer must be in the provided functions, so I need to make sure I'm using them correctly.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Accenture IPO details\nresults = search_pages(\"Accenture IPO 2001 price per share\")\nif results:\n    page_id = results[0]['page_id']\n    content = read_section(page_id + \":full\")\n    if \"price per share\" in content.lower():\n        print(f\"=== {results[0]['title']} ===\")\n        print(content.find(\"price per share\") + 1)\nelse:\n    print(\"Answer not found\")\n</python>"

I need to find this information using the available functions.\n\nFirst, I tried searching for \"Accenture IPO 2001 price per share\" using the search_pages function. The output was empty, which means there might not be a direct result. Maybe the query wasn't specific enough, or the information is spread across different sections.\n\nSince the first attempt didn't find anything, I should try a different approach. Perhaps the IPO details are in a different page or section. Let me think about possible keywords. Instead of \"price per share,\" maybe looking for \"IPO price\" or \"initial public offering price.\" \n\nAnother idea is to search for \"Accenture IPO 2001\" directly. If that doesn't work, maybe checking the company's history or financial details. The user mentioned July 2001, so maybe the date is important. \n\nI should also check if there are any sections related to IPOs or financial data. Using view_sections to explore the structure of the page might help locate the relevant section. Once I find the right section, reading the entire content could reveal the price.\n\nWait, in the previous attempt, the code tried to find \"price per share\" and used the index of that keyword. But if the content doesn't mention it directly, maybe the price is mentioned in a different context, like \"price per share\" being part of a sentence. Alternatively, maybe the price is listed in a table or a specific section.\n\nSince the first search didn't find anything, I need to adjust the query. Let's try searching for \"Accenture IPO 2001\" and then look for the price in the content. If that doesn't work, perhaps checking the company's history or financial reports.\n\nAnother possibility is that the price per share was $18.00, but I need to confirm. However, without access to the actual Wikipedia page, I have to rely on the code's ability to parse the content. The code should check if \"price per share\" is present and extract the number around it.\n\nIn the previous code, the user tried to find the index of \"price per share\" and then add 1 to get the position. But if the content doesn't have that exact phrase, maybe the price is mentioned as \"price per share\" in a different way. Alternatively,"
