Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

Let me start by searching for her birthplace.\n\nFirst, I'll use the search_pages function with the query \"Maxine Beneba Clarke birthplace\". Let's see what pages come up. The first result might be a Wikipedia page about her. Once I get the page, I need to check the sections. Maybe there's a section titled \"Born\" or \"Early life\" that mentions her birthplace.\n\nIf the page is a Wikipedia article, I can use read_section with the page_id to get the full content. Then I'll look for the birthplace information. If the section is too long, I can use view_sections to find the specific section containing the birth details.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that if the first approach fails, I should try different queries. Maybe the initial search for \"Maxine Beneba Clarke birthplace\" doesn't return the right page. Alternatively, maybe the page has a different structure. Let me try to get the full content of the page first.\n\nOnce I have the content, I can search for keywords like \"born\", \"raised\", or \"suburb\" to find the answer. If the content doesn't directly mention the suburb, I might need to look for related information, like her education or other details that could lead to the suburb.\n\nLet me write code to perform these steps. First, search for the page, then read the full content, and look for the birthplace. If that's not found, try another approach.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Maxine Beneba Clarke's birthplace\npages = search_pages(\"Maxine Beneba Clarke birthplace\")\nif pages:\n    page_id = pages[0]['page_id']\n    content = read_section(page_id + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('born')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {content[idx - 20:idx + 20]} ===\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Answer not found\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Answer not found\")\n</python>"

The previous code tried to search for her birthplace by checking the content of a page. The output from the code was \"e Beneba Clarke was born and raised in t\", which seems incomplete.\n\nHmm, the code uses the search_pages function with the query \"Maxine Beneba Clarke birthplace\". The first result's page_id is retrieved, and then the full content is read. The code looks for the word 'born' and extracts a substring around it. But the output shows \"e Beneba Clarke was born and raised in t\" which probably means that the suburb name is missing. Maybe the code didn't capture the exact substring properly.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the code uses a fixed window of 20 characters around the 'born' index. If the actual suburb name is longer, this might not capture it. Alternatively, perhaps the page's content doesn't have the exact phrase \"born and raised in\" but instead has the suburb name somewhere else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should look for \"born in\" or \"raised in\" and extract the suburb from there. Let me think. The original code uses 'born' and takes 20 characters before and after. If the suburb is mentioned as \"in t\" where 't' is the suburb, maybe the code should look for \"born in\" and capture the part after that.\n\nWait, the output from the code was \"e Beneba Clarke was born and raised in t\". The \"t\" here is probably the suburb. But the user needs to know the actual name. Since the code's output shows \"in t\", maybe the suburb is \"Tasmania\" or something else. But without seeing the actual content, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, the user's code might have a mistake. Let me check again. The code uses content.lower().find('born') to find the index of 'born'. Then it takes from idx-20 to idx+20. If the content is \"e Beneba Clarke was born and raised in t\", then the substring from idx-20 to idx+20 would be \"and raised in t\". But the output shows \"e Beneba Clarke was born and raised in t\", which suggests that the code might not have correctly captured the substring. Maybe the 'born' is not at the exact position, or the code is"
