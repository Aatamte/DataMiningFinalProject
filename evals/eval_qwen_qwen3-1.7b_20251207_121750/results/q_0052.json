Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

I need to find this information using Python code and the functions provided.\n\nFirst, I should search for pages related to the polar bear's description in 1774. The query might be something like \"polar bear species 1774\" or \"polar bear description 1774\". Using the search_pages function with that query could give me relevant pages.\n\nOnce I get the results, I need to check each page's content. The answer might be in a section of the page that discusses the classification or description of the polar bear. Maybe there's a section titled something like \"Taxonomy\" or \"Species Description\".\n\nIf the first search returns multiple pages, I should look through each one. For each page, I can use view_sections to find the specific section that contains the information. Then, read the entire section to extract the answer.\n\nI should also consider if there are multiple pages that mention this. If the first search doesn't find anything, I might need to try different keywords or look into other related pages. But since I have only two turns, I need to be efficient.\n\nLet me start by writing the code to search for pages related to the polar bear in 1774. Then, check each page's sections and content for the answer.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for pages related to polar bear description in 1774\npages = search_pages(\"polar bear species 1774\")[:5]\n\nfor page in pages:\n    print(f\"=== {page['title']} ===\")\n    content = read_section(page['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    if \"1774\" in content.lower():\n        print(\"Found reference to 1774\")\n        # Check for species description\n        if \"distinct species\" in content.lower():\n            print(\"Answer found\")\n            print(content[max(0, content.lower().find(\"distinct species\") - 100):content.lower().find(\"distinct species\")+200])\n            exit()\n</python>"

          "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking who was the first to describe the polar bear as a distinct species in 1774. The initial code tried to search for pages related to polar bear species in 1774 and check for the year. But there was an error because 'exit()' wasn't defined. Oh right, in Python, 'exit()' is a function, but maybe the code was using 'exit()' instead of 'sys.exit()'. Or perhaps the code didn't import sys.\n\nSo, the user's code had a mistake in using 'exit()', which is not a valid function. The correct way would be to use sys.exit() or just break out of the loop. But in the code, after finding the answer, it's supposed to print the content and exit. So the error was due to using 'exit()' instead of 'sys.exit()'.\n\nThe original code tried to find the content and then exit. But since the error occurred, the code didn't run properly. So maybe the code needs to be adjusted to use sys.exit() or just break the loop.\n\nBut in the final turn, the user wants the answer. Let's think: the code might have found the answer in one of the pages. The first page that matches \"polar bear species 1774\" might have the description. The code checks if \"1774\" is in the content and then looks for \"distinct species\". If found, it prints the relevant part and exits.\n\nBut since the error occurred, maybe the code didn't run correctly. However, in the example, the user's code was supposed to print the answer. So perhaps the correct approach is to adjust the code to use sys.exit() and then print the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code didn't find any results. But the user's question is about a historical figure, so there should be an answer. The first polar bear species description in 1774 was by Carl Linnaeus, but I'm not sure. Wait, Linnaeus described the polar bear in his 1758 work \"Systema Naturae\". So maybe the answer is Carl Linnaeus. But the code needs to find that.\n\nBut in the code, the user tried to search for \"polar bear species 1774\" and check for the year. If the code didn't find any results, then it would output \"Answer not found\". But since the user is asking for"
