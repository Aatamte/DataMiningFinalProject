Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

Let me start by searching for Fallout 76 on Wikipedia.\n\nFirst, I'll use the search_pages function with the query \"Fallout 76\". The results will give me the relevant pages. Let's see what the first result is. The title might be something like \"Fallout 76\" or maybe a different page. Once I get the page ID, I can read the full content to find the region.\n\nWait, the user is asking for the in-game region, so I need to look for sections that mention the setting. Maybe there's a section titled \"Setting\" or something similar. Let me check the sections of the page. Using view_sections to get the available sections might help identify which one contains the information.\n\nOnce I have the page ID, I can read the full content and look for keywords like \"region\", \"area\", or \"world\" to find the specific name. If the region is mentioned in a section, I can extract it. If not, maybe there's another part of the content to check.\n\nLet me try the first step: search for \"Fallout 76\" and get the page. Then, view the sections to find the right one. If the section is named \"Setting\", I can read that part. If not, maybe the region is described in a different section. Then, extract the name from there.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Fallout 76 page\nfallout_76_pages = search_pages(\"Fallout 76\")\nif fallout_76_pages:\n    page_id = fallout_76_pages[0]['page_id']\n    content = read_section(page_id + \":full\")\n    \n    # Look for in-game region section\n    sections = view_sections(page_id)\n    for section in sections:\n        if \"Setting\" in section['section_name']:\n            region_section = read_section(page_id + \":full\")\n            print(f\"=== In-game Region ===\")\n            print(region_section)\n            break\nelse:\n    print(\"Fallout 76 page not found\")\n</python>"

I need to figure out how to get that information using the tools provided.\n\nFirst, I'll start by searching for the Fallout 76 page. The code tried that and got a response, but the output was empty. Maybe the search returned no results, or the page wasn't found. But the code checked if fallout_76_pages is not empty and took the first one. However, the output was empty, so perhaps the page wasn't found or the content wasn't accessible.\n\nNext, the code tried to view sections of the page to find a section titled \"Setting\". If that section exists, it would read the content. But since the output was empty, maybe the \"Setting\" section isn't present. Alternatively, maybe the page doesn't have a section named \"Setting\", or the content isn't formatted as expected.\n\nSince the initial approach didn't work, I need to think of alternative ways. Maybe the region is mentioned in a different section, like \"Gameplay\" or \"Locations\". Alternatively, perhaps the region is part of the game's description in a different part of the page.\n\nAnother approach could be to search for keywords like \"region\", \"area\", or \"location\" in the page content. But since the code didn't find any sections, maybe the answer is in the first paragraph of the page. Let me check that.\n\nWait, the code tried to look for \"Setting\" in sections. If that section isn't there, maybe the region is mentioned in the main content. The code might need to search the entire page for the term \"region\" or \"Fallout 76 region\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the region is part of the game's description in the main text. Let me try to extract the first few lines of the content to see if the region is mentioned there.\n\nBut according to the previous output, the code didn't find any sections and the content was empty. So perhaps the answer is in the first paragraph of the page. Let me try to print the first few lines of the content to see if the region is there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the region is mentioned in a different section. For example, \"Locations\" or \"Gameplay\". The code should check all sections to find the relevant one.\n\nSince the initial approach didn't work, I'll try a different method.
