Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London.

If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

First, I need to find Clint Howard's voice roles in Disney animations.\n\nI'll start by searching for Clint Howard's filmography. Using the search_pages function with \"Clint Howard\" might give some results. Let me check the first few pages. If there's a page about him, I can look into his voice roles.\n\nOnce I have the relevant pages, I need to check each entry for animated films. The read_section function can fetch the full content of a page. I'll look for mentions of Roo and the films he was in. \n\nWait, maybe there's a specific page where his voice roles are listed. If the initial search doesn't find it, I might need to use different queries or check related sections. For example, searching for \"Roo\" might direct me to the correct films.\n\nI should also consider that Roo is a character from the movie \"The Lion King\" and \"The Little Mermaid,\" but Clint Howard voiced Roo in \"The Lion King.\" However, I need to confirm if that's accurate. Let me check the details.\n\nIf the code finds the page with \"The Lion King\" and mentions Clint Howard as the voice actor for Roo, then that's the answer. If not, I might need to look into other films or check for possible errors in my initial search.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Clint Howard's filmography\nresults = search_pages(\"Clint Howard\")\nif not results:\n    print(\"No results found for Clint Howard's filmography.\")\nelse:\n    # Check the first result for voice roles\n    for r in results[:3]:  # Limit to top 3 results\n        content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n        if \"Roo\" in content.lower():\n            print(f\"\\n=== {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content.lower().split(\"Roo\")[1].split(\"Clint Howard\")[0])\n            break\n</python>"

I need to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I remember that Clint Howard is a comedian, and he's known for his voice work. Roo is a character from the Disney movie \"The Lion King,\" but I'm not sure if he voiced her. Wait, no, in \"The Lion King,\" the voice of Roo is actually by Michael Keaton. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up something here.\n\nWait, the user is asking about Clint Howard providing the voice for Roo. So I need to check if any of his films have Roo as a character. Let me think. Clint Howard did voice some characters in animated movies. For example, he voiced the character \"Roo\" in \"The Lion King,\" but I think that's actually Michael Keaton. Wait, no, maybe it's a different movie.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's \"The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron\" or another animated film. But I'm not sure. Let me try to search for Clint Howard's voice roles in animated Disney films.\n\nWait, the previous code tried searching for Clint Howard's filmography and looked for \"Roo\" in the content. But the output was empty. So maybe there's no such film where Clint Howard voiced Roo. Alternatively, perhaps the code didn't find it because the search wasn't precise.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is that Clint Howard did not voice Roo in any animated Disney films. But I need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different movie. Let me think. In \"The Lion King,\" the voice of Roo is by Michael Keaton, but Clint Howard did voice other characters. For example, in \"The Simpsons,\" he voiced the character Bart Simpson's father, but that's not animated Disney.\n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake here. The user is asking about an animated Disney film where Clint Howard provided the voice for Roo. If the search didn't find any, then the answer would be that there's no such film. But maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is \"The Lion King\" but with a different voice actor. But the user specifically asked about Clint Howard.\n\nGiven that the previous code didn't find any results, maybe the answer is that there's no such film. But I need to check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should look for \"Roo\" in the filmography. Let me think about possible movies where Clint Howard voiced"
