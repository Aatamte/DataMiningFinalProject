Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

The user is asking for the title of the short story by Aka Akasaka that 'Idol' is based on. \n\nFirst, I need to find information about Aka Akasaka and her works. The term \"Idol\" is a title, so maybe I should start by searching for \"Idol\" to see if it's a known work. But the question is about the story that 'Idol' is based on, so perhaps I need to look for the source of 'Idol'.\n\nI'll start by using the search_pages function with the query \"Idol\". Let me check the results. The first result might be a book or a short story collection. Then, I need to find the section that mentions Aka Akasaka and her works.\n\nOnce I have the page ID, I can use view_sections to look for sections related to Aka Akasaka. The title of the story might be in a section named something like \"Stories\" or \"Short Stories\". \n\nAlternatively, maybe the story is part of a larger collection. If I can find the page ID of the book, then read the entire content to look for mentions of Aka Akasaka and the story title.\n\nWait, the user mentioned \"short story by Aka Akasaka\", so maybe the book is titled something like \"The Story of Idol\" or similar. But I need to confirm.\n\nLet me proceed step by step. First, search for \"Idol\" to get the relevant page. Then check if there's a section about Aka Akasaka. If not, try searching for her name directly. \n\nOnce I have the correct page, read the entire content to find the story title. If I can't find it, then output \"Answer not found\".\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for 'Idol' to find the film or work\nresults = search_pages(\"Idol\")\nif results:\n    page_id = results[0]['page_id']\n    content = read_section(page_id + \":full\")\n    if \"Aka Akasaka\" in content.lower():\n        print(\"=== Found in 'Idol' ===\")\n        print(content)\n    else:\n        print(\"=== No direct mention in 'Idol' ===\")\nelse:\n    print(\"=== Could not find 'Idol' ===\")\n</python>"

          "content": "<think>\nOkay, so the user is asking about the title of the short story by Aka Akasaka that 'Idol' is based on. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I tried searching for \"Idol\" using the search_pages function. The output showed that there's no direct mention of Aka Akasaka in the content of the film. That means the initial search didn't find any references to Aka Akasaka's short stories. \n\nSince the first approach didn't work, I need to adjust my strategy. Maybe the 'Idol' film is based on a short story, but the search for the film didn't capture that. Perhaps I should look for the short story first. Let me try searching for \"short story\" and see if there's any mention of Aka Akasaka. \n\nWait, the user mentioned that 'Idol' is based on a short story by Aka Akasaka. So maybe the answer lies in finding the short story first. Let me adjust the search query to look for the short story title. \n\nI'll use search_pages with \"Aka Akasaka short story\" to find any relevant pages. Then, check the content of those pages to see if they mention 'Idol' or any other clues. If I find the short story, I can extract the title. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a section in the film's description that mentions the source material. But since the initial search for 'Idol' didn't find Aka Akasaka, I need to look elsewhere. \n\nLet me try searching for \"Aka Akasaka\" to see if there are any short stories by him. If there's a page about his works, I can check the sections for any references to 'Idol'. \n\nOnce I find the relevant page, I'll read the entire content and look for mentions of 'Idol' or any clues about the short story. If I find the title, that's the answer. If not, maybe the answer is \"Answer not found\".\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Aka Akasaka's short stories\nresults = search_pages(\"Aka Akasaka short story\")\nif results:\n    page_id = results[0]['page_id']\n    content = read_section(page_id + \":full\")\n    if \"Idol\" in content.lower():\n        print(\"=== Found reference to 'Idol' in Aka Akasaka's short story ===\")\n       "
