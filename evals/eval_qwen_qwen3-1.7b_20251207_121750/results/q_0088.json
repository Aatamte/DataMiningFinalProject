Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

          "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question: \"Which drama school in Paris did Pom Klementieff attend?\" \n\nFirst, I need to find information about Pom Klementieff and her education. The user wants to know which drama school she attended in Paris. \n\nI'll start by searching for her name on Wikipedia. The function search_pages can be used with the query \"Pom Klementieff\". Let's see what results we get. \n\nAssuming the search returns a page about her, I need to extract the relevant information. The next step is to look for sections related to her education or training. Maybe there's a section titled \"Education\" or \"Training\". \n\nIf the search returns multiple pages, I should check the first one. Once I get the page content, I can use read_section to get the entire content. Then, I'll look for mentions of drama schools in Paris. \n\nI should check if the page mentions any drama schools, possibly under her biography or education section. If the content is extensive, using view_sections might help to find specific sections. \n\nIf the initial search doesn't find the answer, I might need to try different queries or look for related terms like \"drama school Paris\" or \"Pom Klementieff education\". \n\nLet me write the code to perform these steps. First, search for Pom Klementieff's page. Then, read the full content and look for drama school mentions. If not found, try another approach.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Pom Klementieff's page\nresults = search_pages(\"Pom Klementieff\")\nif results:\n    page_id = results[0]['page_id']\n    content = read_section(page_id + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('education')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {results[0]['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0, idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\nelse:\n    print(\"Answer not found\")\n</python>"

          "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking which drama school in Paris Pom Klementieff attended. The previous code tried to search for her page and look for education info, but there was an error because CONTEXT_BEFORE wasn't defined. Oh right, the user mentioned in the rules that if the code can't run properly, they want the answer even if it's partial.\n\nSo, the first step is to search for Pom Klementieff's page. The initial code did that, but the error was about CONTEXT_BEFORE. Maybe the code didn't properly handle the context when there's no match. Let me adjust the code to handle that.\n\nWait, in the previous attempt, the code used CONTEXT_BEFORE and CONTEXT_AFTER variables. But if the search returns empty, the else clause would print \"Answer not found\". However, the user's code might have had those variables defined elsewhere. But in the final turn, the assistant has to write the code now.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to first search for Pom Klementieff's page. If found, extract the education section. If not, output the answer not found. But since the user is in the final turn, maybe they want to make sure the code runs without errors.\n\nLet me write the code again. First, search for the page. If results exist, get the first one's content. Then look for 'education' in the content. If found, extract the relevant part. Otherwise, say answer not found.\n\nAlso, make sure to handle the case where the search returns no results. So the code should check if results is not empty before proceeding.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nSearch for \"Pom Klementieff\" to get the page ID. If results exist, read the full content. Then search for 'education' in the content. If found, print the relevant section. Otherwise, output the answer not found.\n\nThat should handle the error because CONTEXT_BEFORE and CONTEXT_AFTER were not defined in the previous attempt, but in the final turn, we need to write the code correctly. So the code would look like this.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Pom Klementieff's page\nresults = search_pages(\"Pom Klementieff\")\nif results:\n    page_id = results[0]['page_id']\n    content = read_section(page_id + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('education')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {results[0]['"
