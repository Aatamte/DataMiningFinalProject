Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

The user is asking for the name of an Australian actor who was born on June 13, 1996, and starred in \"The Power of the Dog.\" \n\nFirst, I need to find information about Australian actors born on that date and check if any of them are in \"The Power of the Dog.\" \n\nStarting with the search, I'll use the search_pages function with the query \"The Power of the Dog\" to find any mentions of the film and its cast. Then, I'll look for actors in that cast who are Australian and born on June 13, 1996.\n\nBut wait, the initial search might not directly give the actor's name. So maybe I need to first find the cast of \"The Power of the Dog\" and then check their birth dates. \n\nLet me try searching for \"The Power of the Dog cast\" to get the list of actors. Then, filter those who are Australian and have a birthdate of June 13, 1996. \n\nBut how do I perform this search? The user's code examples use search_pages with a query. So perhaps first, I'll search for \"The Power of the Dog\" to get the film's pages. Then, look at the cast details.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can search for \"The Power of the Dog\" and then look for the actor's name in the cast list. But I need to check if the search_pages function can retrieve the cast information.\n\nWait, the functions available are search_pages, view_sections, read_section. So maybe I need to first find the film's page, then look into sections like \"Cast\" or \"Production Credits.\"\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Search for \"The Power of the Dog\" to get the film's page.\n2. Check if there's a \"Cast\" section or similar in that page.\n3. If found, read the content of that section to get the cast list.\n4. For each actor in the cast, check if they are Australian and born on June 13, 1996.\n\nBut the code needs to be written in Python. Let me try writing the first part: search for the film.\n\nFirst, search_pages(\"The Power of the Dog\") to get the film's pages. Then, check if any of them have a \"Cast\" section.\n\nOnce I get the film's page ID, I can use view_sections to"
