Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

The user mentioned a specific year and event, so I should look for records related to that.\n\nI'll start by searching Wikipedia for Parveen Kaur. The query might be \"Parveen Kaur\" to find her profile. Then, I need to check if there's any information about the film festival she attended in 2017. \n\nUsing the search_pages function with \"Parveen Kaur\" could help find her pages. Once I get the page details, I can read the full content to look for mentions of the festival and any awards awarded. \n\nIf the initial search doesn't find direct info, maybe I need to check sections or specific sections related to film festivals. For example, if there's a section about awards or events in 2017. \n\nI'll write code to search for Parveen Kaur's page, then check the sections. If the full content doesn't have the answer, maybe I can look for keywords like \"award\" or \"festival\" in the text. \n\nAlso, the user specified the year 2017 and the festival name \"Mosaic International South Asian Film Festival\". So I should look for mentions of that festival in her bio. \n\nIf the code finds the award mention, I can extract it. If not, maybe the answer isn't there, and I need to output that.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Parveen Kaur's page\npages = search_pages(\"Parveen Kaur\")\nif pages:\n    # Check the first result for full content\n    page_id = pages[0]['page_id']\n    content = read_section(page_id + \":full\")\n    \n    # Look for mentions of the festival and awards\n    if \"Mosaic International South Asian Film Festival\" in content:\n        print(f\"\\n=== Parveen Kaur ===\")\n        print(content.lower().find(\"Mosaic International South Asian Film Festival\"))\n    else:\n        print(\"<answer>Answer not found</answer>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"<answer>Answer not found</answer>\")\n</python>"
