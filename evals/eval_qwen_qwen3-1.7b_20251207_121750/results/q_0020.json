Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London.

If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

I know that Hindi was introduced as an official language in various states, but the question is about the first one. I remember that some states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar had Hindi as an official language, but I'm not sure about the exact year. The user mentioned 1881, so maybe it's a specific state.\n\nSince the answer is from historical data, I should search Wikipedia for information on Indian states and their official languages. The user mentioned using the functions available, so I need to use search_pages and read_section.\n\nLet me start by searching for pages related to Indian states and their official languages. The query could be something like \"Indian state official language history\" or \"Hindi as official language in India\". \n\nUsing the search_pages function with a query like \"Indian state official language\" might return pages about different states. Then, I need to check each page's content to find when Hindi was adopted as the sole language and replace Urdu.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a more specific query like \"Hindi official language in India\" could lead to the right information. Once I find the relevant page, I can look for sections about when Hindi was adopted.\n\nAnother approach is to search for the year 1881 and see which state's history mentions that. For example, searching for \"1881 Indian states\" might give information about the then official languages.\n\nBut since I can only use the functions provided, I need to structure the code step by step. First, search for pages related to Indian states and their official languages. Then, read the content of those pages to find the answer.\n\nLet me write code to search for pages about Indian states and their official languages. Then, read the sections of the first result to find when Hindi was adopted as the sole language.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for pages related to Indian states and official languages\npages = search_pages(\"Indian state official language history\")\n\n# Check the first result for relevant information\nif pages:\n    page_id = pages[0]['page_id']\n    content = read_section(page_id + \":full\")\n    \n    # Look for mentions of Hindi being adopted as sole official language in 1881\n    idx = content.lower().find(\"hindi as sole official language\")\n    if idx != -1:\n"

The user is asking which Indian state was the first to adopt Hindi as its sole official language in 1881, replacing Urdu. \n\nFirst, I need to find information about Indian states and their official languages. The previous code tried searching for \"Indian state official language history\" and retrieved some pages. The first page's content was about the Indian Constitution and the adoption of Hindi as the official language in 1949, but the question is about 1881. So, that's not it.\n\nHmm, maybe the search query needs to be more specific. The user mentioned 1881, so perhaps looking for states that changed their official languages around that time. The code in the previous attempt checked the first result but didn't find the answer. Let's think of other possibilities.\n\nWait, maybe the state of Punjab? I remember that in 1881, Punjab was a British colony and the official language was Urdu. But later, after independence, Hindi became the official language. However, the question says \"first to adopt Hindi as sole official language in 1881,\" which might not be Punjab. \n\nAnother possibility is that the state of Bengal or some other state. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the code needs to search for \"Hindi official language adoption\" or \"Indian state languages history\".\n\nWait, the previous code tried searching for \"Indian state official language history\" and got a page that talks about the Indian Constitution. But the user's question is about 1881, so maybe the code should look for states that changed their official languages in that year. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is Punjab. Even though it was Urdu until 1947, maybe in 1881 it was the first to adopt Hindi as a major language. But I'm not certain. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should search for \"Hindi as official language in Indian states\" and look for the earliest adoption. \n\nBut since the user is expecting an answer, and given that in 1881, Punjab was a British colony and Urdu was the official language. However, after 1947, Hindi became the official language of India. So perhaps the answer is Punjab. But I need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should search for \"Punjab official language history\" and check if in 1881, Hindi was adopted. But the previous code"
