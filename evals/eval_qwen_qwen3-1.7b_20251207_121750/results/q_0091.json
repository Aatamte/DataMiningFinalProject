One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London.

The user is asking for the name of a powerful sword linked to the Archon bloodline in Fable's story. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what I know about the game Fable. The Archon is a significant figure in the game, and there's a sword associated with them. From what I remember, the Archon is a powerful warrior, and in the game, there's a sword called the \"Sword of the Archon\" or something similar. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nSince the user wants me to use Python code to search Wikipedia, I need to structure my approach. The steps would be:\n\n1. Search for pages related to \"Fable\" to find the Archon and the sword.\n2. Look for sections that mention the Archon's bloodline and their associated items.\n3. Extract the name of the sword from the relevant sections.\n\nLet me start by searching for pages related to \"Fable\" and \"Archon\". The first step is to use the search_pages function with the query \"Fable Archon\" to find relevant pages. Then, I can check each page's sections to see if there's information about the sword.\n\nOnce I find the correct page, I need to read the entire content to look for mentions of the sword. The user mentioned using the read_section function with the page_id and full content. So, I'll need to get the full text of the page where the Archon is discussed.\n\nI should also check if there are any sections that specifically mention the sword. Maybe there's a section titled \"Sword of the Archon\" or something similar. If I find that, I can extract the name from there.\n\nIf the initial search doesn't yield results, I might need to try different queries or look for related terms like \"Fable sword\" or \"Archon weapon\". But since I have only two turns, I need to be efficient.\n\nLet me write the code step by step. First, search for pages related to \"Fable\" and \"Archon\". Then, check each page's sections. If the sword is mentioned in one of the sections, extract it. If not, try another approach.\n\nWait, the user's example used a specific structure where they searched for a film and then looked for director info. So maybe I need to follow a similar approach here.\n\nLet me try the first part: searching for pages related to \"Fable\""
