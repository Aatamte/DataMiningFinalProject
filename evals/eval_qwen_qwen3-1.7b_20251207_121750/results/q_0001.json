Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

Let's start by searching for the movie and then look for Jacob Tremblay's role.\n\nFirst, I'll use the search_pages function with the query \"Luca 2021\" to find the relevant page. Then, I'll check the content of that page to see if Jacob Tremblay is mentioned. If he is, I need to find the section where the character details are listed.\n\nIf the initial search doesn't find Jacob Tremblay immediately, maybe I should look for his biography or a section that lists his roles. The user mentioned using view_sections to find specific sections, so perhaps there's a section titled something like \"Voices\" or \"Characters\" that lists the actors and their roles.\n\nOnce I have the page ID, I can use read_section to get the full content and look for mentions of Jacob Tremblay. If he's mentioned, I need to parse the text to find the character name. If there's no direct mention, maybe I need to search for his name in other sections or use different keywords.\n\nI should also consider that the character's name might be listed in a section with other details, so I need to check all relevant sections. If the answer is not found after trying these steps, I'll have to conclude that it's not present.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for the 2021 Pixar film 'Luca'\nluca_page = search_pages(\"Luca 2021\")[:1][0]\ncontent = read_section(luca_page['page_id'] + \":full\")\n\n# Check if Jacob Tremblay is mentioned in the film's details\nif \"Jacob Tremblay\" in content.lower():\n    print(\"=== Luca ===\")\n    print(content.lower().split('Luca')[1].split('Jacob Tremblay')[0])\nelse:\n    print(\"Answer not found\")\n</python>"

The user mentioned it's the 2021 Pixar film, so I need to check that first. \n\nFirst, I'll use the search_pages function with \"Luca 2021\" to find the relevant page. The initial code did that and got a page_id. Then, it read the full content of that page. \n\nThe problem is that the initial code didn't find Jacob Tremblay mentioned. So, maybe the film's details aren't in the main content. Maybe I need to look for sections related to voice actors or cast members. \n\nWait, the user's code checked if \"Jacob Tremblay\" is in the content. Since it wasn't found, perhaps the answer is in a different section. Maybe there's a section titled \"Cast\" or something similar. Let me try using view_sections to check the structure of the page. \n\nSo, I'll call view_sections on the luca_page's page_id to see what sections are available. Then, I can check if there's a section named \"Cast\" or something related. Once I find the correct section, read its content to see who voiced which character.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the film's details are in a different part of the page. Let me try to search for \"voice actors\" or \"cast\" in the content. If the initial search didn't find it, maybe I need to look for more specific keywords.\n\nAnother approach: Since the user's code didn't find anything, perhaps I should search for the film's details again but look for more clues. Maybe the character names are mentioned in a different part of the text, like under a section about the story or characters.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is in the \"Cast\" section. Let me try to view that section first. So, I'll use view_sections on the luca_page's page_id to get the list of sections. Then, check if \"Cast\" is one of them. If it is, read the content of that section.\n\nOnce I have the Cast section's content, I can look for Jacob Tremblay and see which character he voiced. If the Cast section isn't there, maybe I need to search for other sections or use a different query.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is in the \"Characters\" section. Let me try that. But without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit tricky. \n\nIn the initial code"
