Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London.

If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

The user is asking which Taylor Swift song spent eight weeks at number one, marking her longest run at the top of the Billboard Hot 100. \n\nFirst, I need to find out which song by Taylor Swift has the longest run at number one. The question mentions it spent eight weeks there, which is the longest recorded for her. But I need to confirm that this is indeed the case.\n\nI should start by searching for Taylor Swift's songs that reached number one. The Billboard Hot 100 chart is the key here. I'll use the search_pages function with a query related to Taylor Swift and \"number one\" to find relevant pages. \n\nOnce I get the results, I need to check which songs have eight weeks at number one. The search_pages function will return a list of pages, and I can look through each to find the ones that have the longest duration. \n\nBut since the user mentioned it's her longest run, I should look for the song that has the highest number of weeks at number one. However, if there are multiple songs with eight weeks, I need to determine which one is the correct answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a specific song that's well-known for this record. I recall that \"All Too Well\" is one of Taylor Swift's longest-running number-one hits, but I need to verify if it's exactly eight weeks. \n\nWait, the question specifies \"eight weeks at number one,\" so I need to make sure that's accurate. Let me check the search results. \n\nIf the first result is \"All Too Well,\" then that's the answer. But if not, I need to look further. \n\nI'll start by searching for Taylor Swift's songs on the Billboard Hot 100. Then, check each song's duration at number one. If there are multiple songs with eight weeks, I need to find which one is the correct answer. \n\nBut since the user mentioned it's her longest run, I should prioritize that. However, if there are multiple songs with eight weeks, the answer might be one of them. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Lover\" is another candidate. But I need to confirm the exact duration. \n\nIn any case, using the search_pages function with \"Taylor Swift number one\" should help find the relevant pages. Then, check each song's duration and select the one that matches eight weeks.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Taylor Swift's songs on Billboard Hot "

The longest run at the top would be the one that stayed there for the maximum duration. I remember that \"Shake It Off\" was a big hit, but I'm not sure about the duration. Let me check.\n\nI'll start by searching for Taylor Swift's songs on Billboard Hot 100. Using the search_pages function with the query \"Taylor Swift song\" might help. Then, I can look for songs that have a duration of eight weeks at number one.\n\nWait, the user mentioned using Python code to search Wikipedia. So I need to use the functions provided: search_pages, view_sections, and read_section. But since this is the final turn, I need to make sure the code is efficient.\n\nLet me first try searching for Taylor Swift's songs on Billboard. The search_pages function might return a list of pages, and then I can check each one's content. The key is to find the song that has a duration of eight weeks at number one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can search for \"Billboard Hot 100 number one songs\" to find the list of songs that spent eight weeks at number one. Then, check which of those is by Taylor Swift.\n\nBut since I can only use the functions provided, I'll proceed step by step. Let's first search for Taylor Swift's songs on Billboard Hot 100.\n\nSo, the code would be something like:\n\nsearch_pages(\"Taylor Swift song\") to get the relevant pages. Then, for each page, read the full content and check if the song spent eight weeks at number one.\n\nBut I need to look for the specific information. The user mentioned that the answer might be in the content of the pages, so I'll need to extract that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a known song by Taylor Swift that has this record. I recall \"All Too Well\" was a long stay, but I'm not sure about the duration. Another possibility is \"Love Story,\" but that's from a different era.\n\nWait, \"Shake It Off\" was number one for two weeks in 2014. But the question says eight weeks. Maybe \"All Too Well (1989)\" was number one for a longer period? Or maybe \""
