Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London.

If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4.

          "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out which metric is cited as a symmetrical extension of the F1 score addressing its lack of symmetry. \n\nFirst, I know that the F1 score is a measure of a model's accuracy in classification. It's the harmonic mean of precision and recall, calculated as 2*(precision*recall)/(precision + recall). However, the F1 score is not symmetric because precision and recall are not necessarily equal. \n\nThe question mentions a metric that's symmetrical and addresses the lack of symmetry in F1. I remember that there's a metric called the F2 score, which is similar to F1 but uses recall instead of precision in the harmonic mean. Wait, no, maybe it's the F0.5 score? Or perhaps another metric like the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC)? Wait, MCC is a measure of accuracy that takes into account true positives, false negatives, false positives, and true negatives. It's symmetric but not sure if it's related to F1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the metric is called the \"symmetric F-score\" or something similar. Wait, the symmetric F-score is another term for the F1 score, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the symmetric F-score is actually a different metric. Let me think again.\n\nThe original F1 score is 2*(precision*recall)/(precision+recall). The symmetric version might be the F0.5, which is calculated as sqrt(precision*recall). But that's not exactly symmetric. Alternatively, the F1 score is sometimes considered asymmetric because precision and recall are different.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is the \"F2 score\" which is calculated as sqrt(precision*recall). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the \"F-measure\" is the same as F1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is the \"accuracy\" metric, but that's not symmetric either.\n\nWait, another thought: the F1 score is asymmetric because it's a harmonic mean. The symmetric version would be something else. I recall that the \"symmetric F-score\" is a metric that's symmetric and addresses the lack of symmetry in F1. But I need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the \"Matthews correlation coefficient\" (MCC), which is symmetric and measures the quality of a binary classification model. But MCC isn't directly related to F1.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is the \"F2 score\", which is calculated as (precision * recall) /"
