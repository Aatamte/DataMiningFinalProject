Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

The result might be a page about the Panther tank. Once I get that page, I can read its full content to find the engine details.\n\nIf the search returns a page with the correct information, I'll extract the part about the engine. If not, maybe I need to look into related pages or sections. Alternatively, if the initial search doesn't find it, I might need to try different queries or check sections of the page.\n\nLet me write code to search for the Panther KF51. If the first result is the correct page, I'll read its full content and look for engine specifications. If not, I'll try another search or check sections.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for the Panther KF51 page\npanther_page = search_pages(\"Panther KF51\")[0]\ncontent = read_section(panther_page['page_id'] + \":full\")\n\n# Look for engine information in the content\nengine_info = None\nfor line in content.splitlines():\n    if \"engine\" in line.lower() or \"power\" in line.lower():\n        engine_info = line\n        break\n\nif engine_info:\n    print(f\"=== Panther KF51 Engine ===\")\n    print(engine_info)\nelse:\n    print(\"Answer not found\")\n</python>"

Let me think.\n\nFirst, I remember that the Panther KF51 was a German tank from World War II. I need to find out its engine details. The previous code searched for \"Panther KF51\" and retrieved the page content. Then it looked for lines with \"engine\" or \"power\" keywords.\n\nIn the output, the engine info was found as MTU MB 873 Ka-501 V-12 water-cooled diesel. The code extracted that line and printed it. So the answer should be MTU MB 873 Ka-501 V-12 water-cooled diesel. The code correctly identified the engine type, so the answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\n<answer>MTU MB 873 Ka-501 V-12 water-cooled diesel</answer>"
