Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London.

          "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about Anh Do, a business owner who started at age 14 before entering the entertainment industry. I need to find out what business he started.\n\nFirst, I should search for Anh Do's background. The initial approach might be to look up his name on Wikipedia. Using the search_pages function with \"Anh Do\" might retrieve some pages. Let's see what happens.\n\nIf the search returns a page about Anh Do, I can check the sections. Maybe there's a section titled \"Businesses\" or something similar. Alternatively, maybe there's a section that mentions his early ventures.\n\nIf the first search doesn't find enough info, I might need to try different queries. For example, searching for \"Anh Do business\" or \"Anh Do early career\". But since I have only two turns, I need to be efficient.\n\nIn the first turn, I'll use search_pages(\"Anh Do\") to get relevant pages. Then, check the sections of the first result. If the page has a section about his business, read that section. If not, maybe look for other sections or use view_sections to find the right part.\n\nIf the content doesn't directly mention it, perhaps there's a need to search for related terms. But given the constraints, I'll proceed step by step.\n\nLet me write code to search for Anh Do's pages and then check the sections. If the first result doesn't have the answer, try another search in the same script.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Anh Do's pages\npages = search_pages(\"Anh Do\")\nif pages:\n    # Check the first page's sections\n    sections = view_sections(pages[0]['page_id'])\n    for section in sections:\n        if \"business\" in section['section_name'].lower():\n            content = read_section(pages[0]['page_id'] + \":full\")\n            print(f\"\\n=== {section['section_name']} ===\")\n            print(content)\n            break\nelse:\n    print(\"No pages found for Anh Do.\")\n</python>"

          "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking about Anh Do's business started at age 14 before his entertainment career. The previous code tried to search for pages related to Anh Do and check sections for the word \"business\". But the output was empty, so maybe there's no section with that exact phrase.\n\nHmm, perhaps the business isn't explicitly mentioned in the sections. Maybe it's in a different part of the page. Let me think about alternative approaches. Maybe the business name is mentioned in the content but not in a section title. The code checked sections, but maybe the business is in the body text.\n\nWait, the code used view_sections to get sections of the first page. If there's no section with \"business\", maybe the business is in the content itself. The code might need to search the entire content for mentions of the business.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the business is mentioned in a different context, like a quote or a separate section. Let me adjust the code to search the entire content for \"business\" or related terms. Also, maybe the business name is part of a sentence, like \"started a business in...\" or \"founded a company\".\n\nAnother idea: The code could search the entire content for any mention of Anh Do's business, even if it's not in a section. So instead of checking sections, maybe extract the content and look for keywords. Let me try modifying the code to search the full content for the business.\n\nSo, the plan is: Search pages for Anh Do, then read the full content of the first page and look for any mention of his business. If found, extract it; if not, check other pages or try different keywords.\n\nLet me write the code to do that.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Anh Do's pages\npages = search_pages(\"Anh Do\")\nif pages:\n    # Read full content of the first page\n    content = read_section(pages[0]['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    # Search for business-related mentions in the content\n    if \"business\" in content.lower():\n        print(f\"\\n=== Business Mention ===\")\n        print(content.lower().split(\"business\")[0].strip() + \" ...\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No business mention found in the content.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No pages found for Anh Do.\")\n</python>"
