Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

Let me start by searching for information about him.\n\nFirst, I'll use the search_pages function with the query \"James Cromwell\" to find relevant pages. The user mentioned using the search_pages function, so I'll set up a limit of 3 results. Then, I'll check each result to see if they mention his education.\n\nLooking at the first result, the title is \"James Cromwell - Wikipedia\". The content might have information about his education. I'll use the read_section function with the page_id + \":full\" to get the entire content. I need to look for keywords like \"Bachelor of Fine Arts\" or \"graduated from\".\n\nIf the first result doesn't have that info, I'll try the next search. Maybe there's another page or section that mentions his education. Alternatively, I could use view_sections to check specific sections like \"Education\" or \"Career\" in the page. But since I have limited turns, I need to be efficient.\n\nWait, the user's example used a loop and checked multiple pages. So I should structure my code to check each search result, extract the relevant sections, and look for the degree. If the first search doesn't find it, I'll try another query or check different sections.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not making up facts. The answer must be from the content. So, if the first search returns a page with his education details, I'll extract that. If not, try another query.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for James Cromwell's education\nresults = search_pages(\"James Cromwell\")\nfor r in results[:3]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    if \"Bachelor of Fine Arts\" in content.lower():\n        print(f\"\\n=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content.lower().split(\"Bachelor of Fine Arts\")[1].split(\"graduated from\")[0])\n        break\n</python>"

          "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking which university James Cromwell graduated from with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. \n\nFirst, I need to find information about James Cromwell's education. The previous code tried searching for \"James Cromwell\" and looked for \"Bachelor of Fine Arts\" in the content. But the output was empty, which means maybe the search didn't find the relevant section.\n\nMaybe the problem is that the initial search returned results that don't have the exact phrase. Alternatively, the content might be structured differently. Let me think: the code splits the content by \"Bachelor of Fine Arts\" and takes the part after that. If the search didn't find the exact phrase, perhaps the actual text mentions it differently, like \"BFA\" or \"Bachelor of Fine Arts\" without the word \"degree\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the page isn't structured to have that information in the first place. Let me try a different approach. Maybe using a more specific query, like \"James Cromwell education\" or \"James Cromwell Bachelor of Fine Arts\". Also, checking if the page has a section about his education.\n\nAnother possibility is that the university's name is mentioned in a different context. For example, maybe the page mentions he studied at a university but doesn't explicitly state the name. The code might need to look for keywords like \"university\" or \"college\".\n\nLet me adjust the search query to be more specific. Maybe using \"James Cromwell education\" and then looking for \"Bachelor of Fine Arts\". Also, check if the content has a section labeled \"Education\" or similar.\n\nAlternatively, use the view_sections function to check if there's a section titled \"Education\" or \"Degrees\". If that exists, read the content of that section. But since the code is limited to one script, maybe I can try searching for the exact phrase again.\n\nWait, in the previous attempt, the code found the content but the output was empty. Maybe the split method isn't working as expected. Let me try a different way: search for \"Bachelor of Fine Arts\" and then look for the university name in the same paragraph.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the university is mentioned in a different part of the text. For example, after the degree, like \"graduated from [university]\". So, the code could split on the degree and then take the part after.\n\nAnother approach: use regex to find the university name. For example, using re.search to find the pattern after \"Bachelor of Fine"
