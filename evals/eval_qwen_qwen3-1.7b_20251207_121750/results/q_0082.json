Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

I need to find this information using the provided functions.\n\nFirst, I should search for \"Battlestar Galactica\" to find the relevant pages. Then, look for mentions of Katee Sackhoff and any awards she won. The search_pages function can be used with the query \"Battlestar Galactica\" to get related pages. \n\nOnce I have the page details, I need to read the entire content of the page. Then, check for sections that might contain award information. Maybe there's a section titled \"Awards\" or something similar. \n\nAlternatively, the user might have mentioned the show and the year, so maybe searching for \"Katee Sackhoff Battlestar Galactica 2005\" could help. But the initial approach is to start with \"Battlestar Galactica\" and see if there's any mention of her awards.\n\nLet me try the first step: search for \"Battlestar Galactica\" to get the page IDs. Then, read the full content of that page. Look for sections or paragraphs where Katee Sackhoff is mentioned and any awards she received. \n\nIf the search returns a page with information about her, I can extract the award details. If not, maybe try another query or check different sections. Since there's only two turns, I need to be efficient.\n\nWait, the user might have already provided some context. Let me think: Katee Sackhoff is the actress who played Commander Sarah Jane Smith in Battlestar Galactica. She won an Emmy Award for her role in 2005. But I need to confirm this through the code.\n\nSo, first, search for \"Battlestar Galactica\" to get the page. Then read the full content. Look for sections related to awards. Maybe there's a section titled \"Awards\" or \"Accomplishments\". If not, check the entire content for mentions of her and awards.\n\nIf the code can't find it in the first search, maybe try a different query like \"Katee Sackhoff Battlestar Galactica 2005\" to target her specific work and year. But the initial search might have already included that.\n\nLet me write the code step by step. First, search for \"Battlestar Galactica\" to get the page IDs. Then"
