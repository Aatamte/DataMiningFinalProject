Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

The user is asking which congressional district of California Kevin McCarthy represents since 2007 after renumbering. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out Kevin McCarthy's current district. I know that congressional districts can change over time, so the renumbering might have affected his district. But I need to confirm the exact district he's representing now.\n\nI'll start by searching for Kevin McCarthy's current information. The query should be something like \"Kevin McCarthy congressional district California 2024\" to get the latest data. Using the search_pages function with that query might return a page with his information.\n\nOnce I get the relevant page, I need to check for any mentions of congressional districts. The user mentioned he's represented since 2007, so the answer might be in a section that lists his current district. If the search returns multiple results, I should look for the most recent one.\n\nIf the initial search doesn't find the answer immediately, maybe I need to check other pages or use different keywords. For example, if the first result is from a year ago, I can try searching for \"Kevin McCarthy current district\" to get the latest information.\n\nAnother approach is to use the view_sections function to look for sections that list districts. If the page has a section titled \"Congressional District\" or similar, I can extract that information. Then, I'll read the section to find the specific district number.\n\nI should also consider that Kevin McCarthy might have been assigned a new district after some renumbering. The answer could be in a section that states his current district, even if it's not the same as before. For example, he might have moved to a different district after some changes in the congressional map.\n\nIf I can't find the answer directly, I'll have to make an educated guess based on available information. However, I must ensure that the answer is accurate by only using the data from the search results. If the search returns no relevant information, I'll have to conclude that the answer isn't found.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Kevin McCarthy's current congressional district in California\nfor r in search_pages(\"Kevin McCarthy congressional district California 2024\")[:5]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    if \"Congressional District\" in content.lower():\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0, content.lower().find('Congressional"
