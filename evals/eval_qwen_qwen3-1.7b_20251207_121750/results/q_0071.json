Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London.

If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

I need to find her birthplace from Wikipedia.\n\nFirst, I used the search_pages function with \"Ayo Edebiri\" to get her Wikipedia page. The response gave me the title \"Ayo Edebiri\" and the content. Then I looked for the word \"born\" in the content to find the birthplace.\n\nIn the output, the content mentions she was born on October 3, 1995. The sentence is: \"born October 3, 1995) is an American comedian...\" The birthplace is explicitly stated as October 3, 1995. But the question is asking for where she was born, not the date. Wait, the content doesn't mention the birthplace location, like a city or country. It just says she was born on that date. \n\nHmm, the problem is that the provided content doesn't include the birthplace location. The user's question requires the city or country, but the answer given only has the date. So maybe there's a mistake in the search results, or perhaps the Wikipedia page doesn't have that information. Alternatively, maybe the date is part of a link or another detail. \n\nBut according to the output, the content doesn't mention where she was born. The user's question is asking for the birthplace, but the answer provided only has the date. So in that case, the answer would be that it's not found. However, the user might expect the date to be part of the answer, but the question is about the location. \n\nWait, maybe the date is in a different context. For example, if the date is part of a link or a note. But in the given content, the date is written as \"born October 3, 1995) is an American comedian...\" without any additional info. So the birthplace isn't specified here. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the birthplace is not found in the provided content. But the user's code didn't find it, so the answer would be \"Answer not found\". However, the user's code output shows that the content has the date but not the location. So the correct answer here is that the birthplace isn't specified in the available information.\n</think>\n\n<answer>Answer not found</answer>"
