One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London.

Let me start by searching for the episode.\n\nFirst, I'll use the search_pages function with the query \"Black Mirror episode 'Shut Up and Dance'\". The result should give me the page details. Let's see what the first result is. The title might be something like \"Shut Up and Dance (Black Mirror)\".\n\nOnce I get the page details, I need to read the entire content using read_section with the page_id + \":full\". Then, I'll look for mentions of the criminal act. The episode is about a man who's forced to commit a crime, probably something like theft or fraud. But I need to find the exact wording.\n\nI'll check the content for any references to the criminal act. The key is to find the part where the characters are forced to commit it. Maybe there's a section that talks about the plot details. If I can't find it directly, I might need to search for related terms like \"crime\" or \"act\" in the text.\n\nWait, maybe the criminal act is related to the episode's premise where the man is forced to commit a crime as part of a game or experiment. The answer might be something like \"theft\" or \"fraud\". But I need to confirm by searching the content.\n\nLet me try to extract the relevant part. If the content mentions that the characters are forced to commit a specific act, like stealing or lying, that's the answer. If not, maybe I need to look for other terms. But since I have limited turns, I should try to get the answer in the first attempt.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for the episode and its content\nepisode_info = search_pages(\"Black Mirror episode 'Shut Up and Dance'\")[:3]\nfor page in episode_info:\n    content = read_section(page['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    if \"forced to commit\" in content.lower():\n        print(f\"=== {page['title']} ===\")\n        print(content.lower().find(\"forced to commit\") - CONTEXT_BEFORE)\n        break\n</python>"

The previous code tried to search for the episode but had an error because CONTEXT_BEFORE wasn't defined. So I need to fix that.\n\nFirst, I should check the episode title correctly. The user mentioned \"Shut Up and Dance\", but maybe the search query needs to be exact. Let me adjust the search query to \"Black Mirror episode 'Shut Up and Dance'\" to target that specific title.\n\nThen, the code needs to read the full content of the episode. The previous attempt used a variable CONTEXT_BEFORE, which was undefined. So I should remove that variable and instead use a fixed context length, maybe 100 characters before and after the mention of \"forced to commit\" to capture the relevant part.\n\nWait, but the code might not find the exact phrase. Maybe the episode's content mentions the criminal act without using \"forced to commit\". So I need to look for clues in the text. The episode is about a person who becomes a voyeur, and the criminal act might be something like voyeurism or possibly a specific crime. But the question specifies \"forced to commit\", so perhaps the episode involves someone being forced into a crime, like a murder or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should search for keywords like \"crime\", \"murder\", or \"voyeurism\" to find the relevant part. But since the user's code tried to find \"forced to commit\", maybe the actual text mentions the act without that phrase. So perhaps the answer is about voyeurism, which is a criminal act.\n\nBut how to confirm? The code needs to search the episode's content. Let me adjust the code to search for \"forced to commit\" and then extract the part around that. If the code doesn't find it, maybe the answer is about voyeurism.\n\nWait, the error was about CONTEXT_BEFORE not being defined. So in the code, I should remove that variable and use a fixed number, like 100 characters. Let me rewrite the code to handle that.\n\nSo, the steps are: search for the episode, read the full content, check if \"forced to commit\" is present, and then extract the relevant part. If not found, look for other keywords.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the episode's content mentions the criminal act as \"voyeurism\" or similar. So the answer might be voyeurism, but I need to confirm.\n\n"
