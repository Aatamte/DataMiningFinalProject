Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

The user mentioned looking into Wikipedia, so I should start by searching for the game \"Fable: The Lost Chapters\" on Wikipedia. \n\nI'll use the search_pages function with the query \"Fable: The Lost Chapters\". The result will give me the relevant page. Once I get the page, I need to check if there's information about its publication company. \n\nLooking at the structure of Wikipedia pages, often there's a section like \"Portions\" or \"Platform releases\" that lists different versions of the game. I should check those sections. If the page doesn't have that info, maybe there's a section about the developer or publisher.\n\nAlternatively, if the direct answer isn't found in the first search, I might need to look into related pages or use other sections. But since the user has two turns, I should try to find it in the first turn.\n\nWait, the first step is to search for the game. Let's write code to do that. If the search returns a page, then read the entire content to check for the publisher. If not, try different keywords or sections.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the game's page has a section like \"Publisher\" or \"Developer\". Let me try to extract that information. If the code finds it, then the answer is there. If not, maybe the answer is in another part of the page.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Search for \"Fable: The Lost Chapters\" to get the page.\n2. Read the entire content of that page.\n3. Look for sections like \"Portions\", \"Platform releases\", or \"Publisher\".\n4. Extract the company name from those sections.\n\nIf the code can't find it in the first attempt, maybe try a different query or check other sections. But given the constraints, I'll proceed with the first search.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for the game to find its Wikipedia page\ngame_page = search_pages(\"Fable: The Lost Chapters\")[:1]\nif game_page:\n    content = read_section(game_page[0]['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    # Check for publisher information in the page\n    if \"publisher\" in content.lower():\n        print(f\"=== {game_page[0]['title']} ===\")\n        print(content"

The user is asking which company published the Mac OS X port of Fable: The Lost Chapters. \n\nFirst, I need to find the Wikipedia page for Fable: The Lost Chapters. The previous code tried searching for the game and got a result. The content was retrieved, but the code stopped before printing the full content. So I need to continue from there.\n\nThe code checks if \"publisher\" is in the content.lower(). If it is, it prints the section. But the code didn't actually print anything. So maybe the publisher info is in a different part of the page. \n\nI should look for sections related to publishing. Maybe there's a section titled \"Publisher\" or something similar. Using view_sections() on the game page's ID could help find the right section. Once the correct section is found, read the entire content to extract the publisher name.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the publisher is mentioned in a different part of the text. Let me check the content again. The initial code found \"publisher\" in the content, but didn't print it. So I need to make sure to extract that part properly.\n\nAnother approach: If the initial search returns the game page, then check for sections. For example, using view_sections() on the game's page ID to see if there's a section about publishers. Then read that section's content to find the answer.\n\nWait, in the previous code, after getting the game_page, the code tried to check if \"publisher\" is in the content. If it is, print the content. But the code didn't actually print anything. So maybe the publisher is in a specific section. Let me try to use view_sections() on the game page to find the correct section.\n\nOnce the correct section is found, read the entire content and look for the publisher. Alternatively, maybe the publisher is mentioned in a paragraph or a specific part of the text.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the publisher is listed under a section like \"Development\" or \"Release\". But without seeing the actual content, it's hard to tell. However, since the user is expecting an answer, I need to proceed step by step.\n\nSo, the plan is: \n\n1. Search for Fable: The Lost Chapters to get its page.\n2. Check if the content has \"publisher\" and print it.\n3. If not, use view_sections() to find the correct section.\n4. Read that section's content and extract the publisher.\n\nBut in the previous code,"
