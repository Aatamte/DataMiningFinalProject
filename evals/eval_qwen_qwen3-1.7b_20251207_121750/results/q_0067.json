Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London.

If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

Let me start by searching for the movie The Outsiders. \n\nFirst, I'll use the search_pages function with the query \"The Outsiders\" to find the relevant page. Then, I'll check the sections of that page to see if there's any information about the actors who appeared in it. \n\nWait, The Outsiders is a 1975 film directed by Robert Towne. But the question mentions the 1980s, so maybe there's a confusion here. However, the user might be referring to the 1975 version. But regardless, I need to check the actors in The Outsiders.\n\nOnce I have the page ID of The Outsiders, I can use read_section to get the full content. Then, I'll look for any mentions of actors and their debuts. The answer might be in the cast list or some other section.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me try searching for the movie first. If the search returns the correct page, then I can check the sections. If not, maybe try different keywords or look for related films.\n\nBut since I have only two turns, I need to be efficient. Let's start by searching for The Outsiders.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for the movie \"The Outsiders\" to find its page\npages = search_pages(\"The Outsiders\")\nif pages:\n    page_id = pages[0]['page_id']\n    content = read_section(page_id + \":full\")\n    # Look for actor names and their debuts\n    actors = []\n    for line in content.splitlines():\n        if \"actor\" in line.lower() or \"actress\" in line.lower():\n            actor = re.search(r'([A-Za-z]+)\\s+([A-Za-z]+)', line.lower())\n            if actor:\n                actors.append(actor.group(1) + \" \" + actor.group(2))\n    if actors:\n        print(f\"=== The Outsiders ===\")\n        print(\"Actors in the film:\")\n        for actor in actors:\n            print(actor)\n    else:\n        print(\"No actors found in The Outsiders.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Movie not found.\")\n</python>"

          "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking which 1980s actor made their feature film debut in The Outsiders. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to find the answer. The previous code tried searching for \"The Outsiders\" and then looked for actors in the content. But the output showed some lines like \"ralph macchio\" and \"the pranks\", which don't seem to be actor names. Maybe the code is not properly extracting the actors.\n\nWait, the code splits the content into lines and checks for \"actor\" or \"actress\" in each line. But the output shows lines like \"the film\", \"the casting\", \"ralph macchio\", etc. The \"ralph macchio\" might be the actor, but the code's regex is looking for names like \"ralph macchio\" and capturing the first and last name. However, in the output, the line is \"ralph macchio\" without any space between the first and last name. The regex uses r'([A-Za-z]+)\\s+([A-Za-z]+)', which would capture \"ralph\" and \"macchio\" as separate groups. So that should extract Ralph Macchio.\n\nBut the problem is that in the output, the actors list has \"the film\" and others, which are not actual names. The code is filtering lines that contain \"actor\" or \"actress\", but maybe the lines like \"the film\" are not being correctly processed. However, the code is splitting the content into lines and checking each line. So perhaps the code is correct, but the output shows that \"ralph macchio\" is in the list. \n\nSo the answer would be Ralph Macchio. But wait, when I look up The Outsiders, I remember that the main actor is Tim Robbins, but maybe he didn't debut in 1980s. Wait, no, Tim Robbins made his debut in The Outsiders (1983). But the question is about a 1980s actor. So Ralph Macchio was in The Outsiders (1983) as a supporting role, but he didn't make his feature film debut in that movie. Wait, maybe the code is incorrect. Let me check.\n\nWait, The Outsiders is 1983, so it's in the 1980s. Ralph Macchio was born in 1963, so he made his debut in"
