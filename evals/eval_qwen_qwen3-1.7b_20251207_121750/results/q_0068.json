Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

Let me start by searching for Clint Howard's involvement in that election.\n\nFirst, I'll use the search_pages function with the query \"Clint Howard 2016 election\" to find relevant pages. Let's see what results we get. The first result might be a news article or a profile about Clint Howard. Once I get the page ID, I can read the full content using read_section with that page ID.\n\nIf the initial search returns a page about Clint Howard's career, I need to look for mentions of the 2016 election. Maybe there's a section about his political activities or endorsements. If the content doesn't mention endorsements directly, I might need to look for other clues, like his social media posts or public statements.\n\nIf the first search doesn't find anything, I can try a different query, like \"Clint Howard 2016 presidential election\" to see if that brings up more specific information. Alternatively, maybe searching for his name in the context of political figures could help. But since I have only two turns, I need to be efficient.\n\nLet me write the code for the first search. If the result is a page with the necessary information, I'll extract it. If not, I'll try another approach. For example, if the page doesn't mention endorsements, maybe looking for his social media posts or other public statements. But since the user wants a direct answer, I need to make sure the code searches correctly.\n\nAnother possibility is that Clint Howard endorsed a specific candidate, like Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. The answer might be in the content of the page he's linked to. So, I'll proceed step by step.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Clint Howard's involvement in the 2016 election\nresults = search_pages(\"Clint Howard 2016 election\")[:3]\nfor r in results:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    if \"2016 election\" in content.lower():\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content.lower().split(\"2016 election\")[1].split(\"endorsement\")[0])\n        break\n</python>"

The user tried using the query \"Clint Howard 2016 election\" and got no results. Maybe the search terms aren't precise enough. Let me think of alternative ways to approach this.\n\nPerhaps searching for \"Clint Howard 2016 election endorsement\" would be better. That way, it's more direct. Let me adjust the search query and check again.\n\nWait, the user's code used \"Clint Howard 2016 election\" and got no output. Maybe the page isn't available or the content isn't there. Let me try a different approach. Maybe looking for his political affiliations or past endorsements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is a well-known figure, like Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton. But I need to confirm. Since the initial search didn't find anything, perhaps the answer is in a different context. Let me check if there's any mention of Clint Howard endorsing someone in the 2016 election.\n\nAnother angle: Clint Howard is an actor, so maybe he endorsed a candidate in a different capacity. But the question specifically mentions the 2016 U.S. presidential election. \n\nSince the initial search didn't yield results, maybe the answer is that there's no recorded information, but the user expects a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the answer is someone like Bernie Sanders, but I need to verify.\n\nWait, perhaps the user's code didn't find anything because the search wasn't accurate. Let me try a different query, like \"Clint Howard 2016 election endorsement\" again. If that doesn't work, maybe the answer is not found.\n</think>\n\n<answer>Answer not found</answer>"
