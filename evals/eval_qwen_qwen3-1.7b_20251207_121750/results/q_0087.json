Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

          "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for the birth name of Lisa from Blackpink, who is a Thai rapper and singer. I need to find her birth name using Python code and the functions provided.\n\nFirst, I should search for Lisa from Blackpink. The function search_pages can be used with the query \"Lisa from Blackpink\" to get relevant pages. Then, I need to read the full content of the page to find her birth name.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are multiple pages. The example code uses the first NUM_RESULTS results. So I should limit to 3 results. Once I get the page ID, I can use read_section with the page_id + \":full\" to get the entire content.\n\nAfter getting the content, I need to look for her birth name. The user mentioned she's a Thai rapper, so maybe the birth name is in the bio section. I'll check for keywords like \"birth name\", \"full name\", or \"parent\". \n\nIf the initial search doesn't find it, maybe I need to look into her biography page. So, after getting the first result, check if the content contains her birth name. If not, try another page. But since the user said to use Python code and the available functions, I need to structure this properly.\n\nLet me write the code step by step. First, search for Lisa from Blackpink. Then, read the full content of the first result. Search for her birth name in that content. If found, return it; otherwise, try another page.\n\nWait, the user might have multiple pages. So perhaps I should check a few pages. But the example code uses a limited number of results. Let me proceed with that.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nUse search_pages with \"Lisa from Blackpink\" to get the first few results. Then, for each result, read the full content and search for her birth name. Once found, output it.\n\nIf no result is found after a few attempts, then the answer might not be found. But according to the rules, I need to output \"Answer not found\" if no answer is found.\n\nLet me write the code accordingly.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Lisa from Blackpink\nresults = search_pages(\"Lisa from Blackpink\")[:3]\nfor page in results:\n    content = read_section(page['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    if \"birth name\" in content.lower():\n        print(f\"\\n=== {page['title']}"

          "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the birth name of the Thai rapper and singer Lisa from Blackpink. I need to find this information using the provided functions.\n\nFirst, I'll start by searching for pages related to Lisa from Blackpink. The initial search might return the main page about her. Then, I need to check the content of that page to find where her birth name is mentioned.\n\nIn the first turn, the user tried searching for \"Lisa from Blackpink\" and got some results. The code then checked the content for \"birth name\" in the first result. However, the output didn't show the birth name directly. Maybe the birth name is in a different section or requires additional searches.\n\nSince the first attempt didn't find the answer, I should consider other possibilities. Maybe the birth name is mentioned in a different part of the page, like under her bio or in an article. Alternatively, there might be a need to search for her biography specifically.\n\nI can use the view_sections function to check if there's a section titled something like \"Biography\" or \"Personal Information\" that contains her birth name. If that's not there, perhaps searching for keywords like \"birth\", \"name\", or \"origin\" could help locate the information.\n\nAnother approach is to search for her name in different contexts, such as her official website or social media profiles. However, the functions available here are limited to the Wikipedia search and reading sections, so I need to stick to that.\n\nLet me try the first approach again. The initial code searched for \"Lisa from Blackpink\" and found a page. The content was checked for \"birth name\", but the result didn't show the birth name. Maybe the birth name is in a different part of the page, like under her discography or awards. Alternatively, there might be a need to look for her university or other educational background, but that's not directly related.\n\nWait, the user mentioned she's a Thai rapper and singer. Maybe her birth name is part of her bio. Let me check the sections again. The code used view_sections to see if there's a section with \"Biography\" or similar. If that's not present, perhaps the birth name is in a section titled \"Personal Life\" or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the birth name is mentioned in an article about her. So, I should search for \"Lisa from Blackpink biography\" to get a more specific result. Then, check the content for her birth name.\n\n"
