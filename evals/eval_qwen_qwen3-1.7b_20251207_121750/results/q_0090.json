If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London.

          "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out which alternative index to BMI uses an exponent of 3. First, I need to recall what BMI is and the different indices used. BMI is a measure of body mass index, calculated as weight divided by height squared. But there are other indices that adjust for factors like body composition or height differences.\n\nThe question mentions an alternative index that uses an exponent of 3. I remember that there's the Quetelet index, which is BMI, but that's exponent 2. Then there's the DuBois formula, which uses an exponent of 3 for height. Wait, the DuBois formula is a body mass index that adjusts for height and age, using a different exponent. But I'm not sure if it's exactly exponent 3.\n\nAlternatively, there's the Mosteller formula, which is used for estimating blood pressure and is also BMI-related. But that's exponent 2 again. Maybe the question refers to the DuBois formula, which is sometimes called the \"DuBois-Buekenhout\" index. Let me check.\n\nWait, the DuBois formula is: BMI = (weight in kg) / (height in meters)^3. So that's exponent 3 for height. But I need to confirm if this is considered an alternative index. The question says \"alternative index to BMI\", so maybe the DuBois formula is that. But I should verify.\n\nAlternatively, there's the Hartman index, which uses exponent 3 as well. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the possible options.\n\nAnother thought: The World Health Organization (WHO) has different formulas. For example, the WHO formula is BMI = weight / height^2, which is exponent 2. The DuBois formula uses exponent 3 for height. So if the question is asking for an alternative index that uses exponent 3, then the DuBois formula would be the answer. But I need to make sure there's no other index with exponent 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the \"Bodine formula\" or another variant. But I think the DuBois formula is the main one that uses exponent 3 for height. So, the answer should be the DuBois formula.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for pages related to BMI indices\nresults = search_pages(\"BMI index\")[:5]\n\nfor result in results:\n    page_id = result['page_id']\n    content = read_section(page_id + \":"

So, the question is about BMI alternatives that use an exponent of 3 to account for height differences. I remember that BMI is calculated as weight divided by height squared, so maybe there's another formula that uses a different exponent.\n\nFirst, I need to search for pages related to BMI indices. The user mentioned using Python code with the functions provided. Let me start by searching for \"BMI index\" to get some results. The first result might be the main page, but I need to check if there are other pages that discuss alternative indices.\n\nLooking at the initial code, the user tried searching for \"BMI index\" and then read the section. The content might have information about different BMI formulas. Since the user is on their final turn, I need to make sure that the code runs correctly and extracts the answer.\n\nWait, in the previous attempt, the user tried to search for \"BMI index\" and then read the section. The code was cut off, so I need to continue from there. The code would check the content for mentions of exponent 3. Maybe the answer is in a section that discusses alternative formulas, like the one using height cubed.\n\nI should check if there's a section in the BMI index page that talks about exponents. If the code is able to find that, then the answer would be extracted. If not, maybe another search is needed. But since this is the final turn, I have to make an educated guess based on the available information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is a known alternative index like the \"BMI z-score\" or something else. But I need to confirm. The user's code is supposed to run, so I should write the code to search for the specific exponent and then extract the answer.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for pages related to BMI indices\nresults = search_pages(\"BMI index\")[:5]\n\nfor result in results:\n    page_id = result['page_id']\n    content = read_section(page_id + \":full\")\n    if \"exponent of 3\" in content.lower():\n        print(f\"=== {result['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0, content.lower().find('exponent of 3') - CONTEXT_BEFORE):])\n        break\n</python>"
