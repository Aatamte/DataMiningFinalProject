Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

Let me start by searching for information about her father.\n\nFirst, I'll use the search_pages function with the query \"Norah O'Donnell father\" to find relevant pages. Let's see what comes up. Maybe there's a Wikipedia page about Norah O'Donnell or her family.\n\nAssuming the search returns a page about Norah O'Donnell, I'll check the sections. The user mentioned using view_sections to find specific sections. Maybe there's a section titled \"Family\" or something similar. Once I get the page ID, I can read the entire content using read_section with the page_id + \":full\".\n\nIf the page has a section about her father, I'll look for keywords like \"father\", \"parent\", or \"parents\". If the content doesn't directly state his profession, I might need to search for related terms or look at other sections. If the initial search doesn't find anything, I'll try different queries or check other pages.\n\nLet me write the code step by step. First, search for Norah O'Donnell's father. Then, check the sections of the resulting page. If the section contains the answer, extract it. If not, try another approach.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Norah O'Donnell's father\nfor r in search_pages(\"Norah O'Donnell father\")[:3]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    if \"father\" in content.lower():\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0, content.lower().find('father')-CONTEXT_BEFORE):content.lower().find('father')+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Check if family section exists\nif \"Family\" in content.lower():\n    print(\"\\n=== Family Section ===\")\n    print(content[max(0, content.lower().find('Family')-CONTEXT_BEFORE):content.lower().find('Family')+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n</python>"

The previous code tried to search for \"Norah O'Donnell father\" and then look for the father's information. But there was an error because CONTEXT_BEFORE wasn't defined.\n\nFirst, I need to fix that error. The code tried to use CONTEXT_BEFORE and CONTEXT_AFTER variables, but they weren't defined. So I should remove those variables or define them properly. Let me check the code again.\n\nIn the initial code, the user had:\n\nfor r in search_pages(\"Norah O'Donnell father\")[:3]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    if \"father\" in content.lower():\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0, content.lower().find('father')-CONTEXT_BEFORE):content.lower().find('father')+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\nBut CONTEXT_BEFORE and CONTEXT_AFTER are not defined. So I need to define them. Let's set them to some reasonable values, like 100 and 400, as in the previous example.\n\nThen, after that, the code checks if \"Family\" is in the content. But the original code had a line that checks if \"Family\" is in the content, but the user's code might not have that part. Wait, the original code had:\n\nif \"Family\" in content.lower():\n    print(\"\\n=== Family Section ===\")\n    print(content[max(0, content.lower().find('Family')-CONTEXT_BEFORE):content.lower().find('Family')+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n\nBut the user's code didn't include that. So maybe the code is incomplete.\n\nSo, to fix the error, I need to define CONTEXT_BEFORE and CONTEXT_AFTER. Let's set them to 100 and 400. Then, proceed with the search.\n\nBut also, the code should check if the father's information is found. If the first search finds the father's info, then print it. Otherwise, check if there's a family section.\n\nBut in the original code, after the first search, there's a check for \"Family\" in the content. However, the code might not have properly handled that.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the corrected code would define CONTEXT_BEFORE and CONTEXT_AFTER, then perform the search, and check for the family section.\n\nBut since the user's code had an error, I need"
