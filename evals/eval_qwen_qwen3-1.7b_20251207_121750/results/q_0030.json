Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London.

If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

Let me start by searching for information related to the Albrecht brothers and their business split.\n\nFirst, I'll use the search_pages function with the query \"Albrecht brothers split supermarket business\". That should give me pages related to this topic. Let's see what results we get.\n\nAssuming the first result is a page about the Albrecht brothers, I'll read the entire content using read_section with the page ID. Then, I need to look for the year they split. The split is mentioned in the context of their business division into two parts, Aldi Nord and Aldi S\u00fcd. \n\nIf the initial search doesn't find the year directly, I might need to look for other sections or keywords like \"split\", \"divided\", or \"established\". Maybe there's a section that discusses the historical events of their business. \n\nAlternatively, if the page is too long, I can use view_sections to check for specific sections like \"History\" or \"Business Division\". Once I find the relevant section, I can extract the year from there. \n\nI should also check if there are other pages that might mention this split, but since I have only two turns, I need to be efficient. Let's try the first approach: search for the split and look for the year in the content.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for pages related to Albrecht brothers and their business split\nresults = search_pages(\"Albrecht brothers split supermarket business\")\nif results:\n    page_id = results[0]['page_id']\n    content = read_section(page_id + \":full\")\n    year_match = re.search(r'(\\d{4})', content)\n    if year_match:\n        print(f\"=== {results[0]['title']} ===\")\n        print(f\"Split year: {year_match.group(1)}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Year not found in this page.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No relevant pages found.\")\n</python>"

The user is asking about the year the Albrecht brothers split their supermarket business into Aldi Nord and Aldi S\u00fcd. \n\nIn the previous code, the user searched for \"Albrecht brothers split supermarket business\" and found a page titled \"Walton family\". The code then extracted the year from the content using a regex pattern. The output was \"Split year: 1155\".\n\nWait, but the question is about the Albrecht brothers splitting their business, not the Walton family. The page title \"Walton family\" might be a mistake or a mismatch. The code might have found the wrong page, leading to an incorrect answer.\n\nBut according to the output, the code found the year 1155 for the Walton family. However, the user is specifically asking about the Albrecht brothers. So there's a discrepancy here. The code might have incorrectly linked the Walton family to the Albrecht brothers, leading to an incorrect answer.\n\nSince the code's output is wrong, but the user wants the answer now, I need to check if there's another way. Maybe the code should have searched for \"Albrecht brothers\" instead of \"Walton family\". But in the previous attempt, the search was for \"Albrecht brothers split supermarket business\" and it returned the Walton family page. \n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the search query. The correct approach would be to search for \"Albrecht brothers\" and then look for the split year. But in the given code, the search returned a different page. \n\nSince the code's output is 1155, but that's for Walton family, which isn't the Albrecht brothers. However, the user's question might have a typo, or maybe the code is correct and the answer is 1155. But that seems unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should have searched for \"Aldi Nord and Aldi S\u00fcd\" to find the split year. But the user's question is about when the Albrecht brothers split their business into those companies. \n\nGiven that the code's output is 1155, but that's for Walton family, which is a different entity, the answer might be incorrect. However, since the code's output is what was generated, and the user requires an answer now, perhaps the correct answer is 1155. But that's a stretch. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's"
