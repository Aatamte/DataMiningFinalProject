Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London.

If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

Let me start by searching for information about Terry Nichols and his sentencing.\n\nFirst, I'll use the search_pages function with the query \"Terry Nichols Oklahoma state trial\". The goal is to find pages related to his trial. Let's see what results we get.\n\nOnce I have the relevant page, I need to look for the sentencing details. The answer might be in a section about his trial. If the page is large, I can use view_sections to find specific sections. Maybe there's a section titled \"Sentencing\" or something similar.\n\nIf the page has the sentencing information, I can read the entire section using read_section and extract the consecutive life terms. If not, I might need to search for other related pages or sections. Since I have two turns, I should try to get the answer in the first turn.\n\nLet me write the code to search for the page and then check the sections. If the first result doesn't have the answer, I'll try another query in the same script.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Terry Nichols and Oklahoma state trial\nresults = search_pages(\"Terry Nichols Oklahoma state trial\")\nif results:\n    page_id = results[0]['page_id']\n    content = read_section(page_id + \":full\")\n    if \"sentencing\" in content.lower():\n        print(f\"=== {results[0]['title']} ===\")\n        print(content.lower().find(\"sentencing\") + 1)\nelse:\n    print(\"<answer>Answer not found</answer>\")\n</python>"
