Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London.

If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2 - partial answer beats no answer\n4. If you cannot find the answer, output exactly: <answer>Answer not found</answer>\n5. Extract from content only - never make up facts"

The user mentioned using Python code with the available functions.\n\nFirst, I'll use the search_pages function with the query \"Spider-Man 2\". The goal is to find pages related to the movie. Then, I'll look for sections that might contain revenue information. Maybe there's a section titled something like \"Box Office\" or \"Gross Revenue\".\n\nOnce I have the page ID, I can use read_section with the page_id + \":full\" to get the full content. I need to check if the content includes the revenue numbers. Sometimes, the box office numbers are mentioned in a specific section or within the movie's summary.\n\nIf the initial search returns a page with the revenue info, I can extract the number. If not, maybe I need to search for related terms like \"Spider-Man 2 box office\" or check other sections. Also, I should look for any mentions of worldwide gross revenue, maybe in a section like \"Box Office Results\" or \"Financials\".\n\nI should also consider that the revenue might be listed in a table or a specific section. If the first search doesn't find it, I can try different queries or check other pages. But since I have only two turns, I need to be efficient.\n\nLet me write the code step by step. First, search for Spider-Man 2, then check the sections. If the first result has the revenue, extract it. Otherwise, try another search.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for Spider-Man 2 to find relevant pages\nspider_pages = search_pages(\"Spider-Man 2\")\nif spider_pages:\n    # Check the first result for revenue info\n    page_id = spider_pages[0]['page_id']\n    content = read_section(page_id + \":full\")\n    if \"worldwide gross revenue\" in content.lower():\n        print(f\"=== Spider-Man 2 ===\")\n        print(content.lower().find(\"worldwide gross revenue\"))\n        print(content[max(0, content.lower().index(\"worldwide gross revenue\") - 100):max(0, content.lower().index(\"worldwide gross revenue\") + 200)])\n    else:\n        print(\"=== No revenue info found in initial search ===\")\nelse:\n    print(\"=== No pages found for Spider-Man 2 ===\")\n</python>"

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I tried searching for \"Spider-Man 2\" using the search_pages function. The initial result didn't contain any mention of revenue. Then I checked the first page's content, but the keyword \"worldwide gross revenue\" wasn't found. \n\nHmm, maybe the revenue info is in a different section or part of another page. Since the initial search didn't find it, I need to check other pages. Maybe there's a different page that discusses the movie's financials. Let me try searching for \"Spider-Man 2 revenue\" instead. \n\nWait, the user's first attempt didn't find anything, so maybe I should use a different query. Let me try searching for \"Spider-Man 2 worldwide gross revenue\" to see if that brings up any relevant pages. If that doesn't work, perhaps I need to look for related movies or other sources. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the revenue is mentioned in a section about the movie's box office performance. I should check if there are any sections related to that. If the search_pages returns multiple pages, I can use view_sections to find specific sections. \n\nBut since I only have one more turn, I need to make the most of it. Let me try searching for \"Spider-Man 2 box office\" to see if that gives any information. If that doesn't work, maybe the answer is not found, but I have to provide something. \n\nWait, the user's initial code didn't find anything, so maybe the answer is in a different context. Let me check if there's any other way to extract the revenue from the existing content. Maybe using regex to find numbers related to revenue. \n\nBut since I can only use the functions provided, I need to stick to that. Let me try searching for \"Spider-Man 2 revenue\" again and see if that returns any pages. If not, then I have to conclude that the answer isn't found. \n\nBut the user requires an answer even if it's partial. So, maybe the revenue is mentioned in a section that wasn't captured by the initial search. Let me try searching for \"Spider-Man 2 worldwide gross revenue\" again.\n</think>\n\n<python>\n# Search for 'Spider-Man 2' again with a different query\nspider_pages = search_pages(\"Spider-Man 2 worldwide gross revenue\")\nif spider_pages:\n    page_id"
