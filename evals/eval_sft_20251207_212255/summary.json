His character is 19 years old, a withdrawn and socially-awkward teenager who is easily intimidated by workplace bullies and infantilised by his mother. Joy noted that Kenny's attitude towards sex is indicative of immaturity. Questioned by the much older Hector about what the hackers had caught him doing, Kenny refuses to say the word \"masturbation\", instead using the euphemism \"doing it\". Other moments emphasizing his childlike nature include a series of nervous tics, twitches and stutters exhibited by Kenny, as well as a moment where he urinates himself out of terror when forced to commit a bank robbery.\n\n</python_output>"

It drew the largest audience for a Showtime original series premiere. Season 2 premiered on June 27, 2011. Season 3 premiered on April 8, 2012. On July 31, 2012, *The Big C* was renewed for a fourth and final season, named \"Hereafter\"*,* which premiered on Monday, April 29, 2013, and concluded on May 20, 2013.\n\n## Series overview\n\nThe show follows, in the [Paul](Minneapolis\u2013Saint)(Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul) area, Westhill High School teacher Cathy Jamisona reserved, suburban wife and mother who is diagnosed with [melanoma](melanoma). The realization of this forces her to really begin to live for the first time in her adult life. At first she chooses to keep her diagnosis from her family, behaving in ways they find puzzling and increasingly bizarre. She finds new freedom to express herself. As the show progresses, Cathy allows her family and some new friends to support her as she copes with her terminal prognosis, and finds both humor and pathos in the many idiosyncratic relationships in her life.\n\n## Cast\n\n### Main cast\n\n* [Linney](Laura)(Laura Linney) as Cathy Jamison. Cathy is a [Cities](Twin)(Twin Cities)-area ([Paul](Minneapolis\u2013Saint)(Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul)) high school teacher who, at the start of the series, has been recently diagnosed with terminal (stage IV) melanoma. Reluctant to burden her family and friends with the news, she keeps it a secret for months. She does reveal her illness to elderly neighbor Marlene (who later commits suicide), after Marlene figures it out since her dog, Thomas, who had often been hanging around Cathy, can sniff out cancer. Her behavior dramatically changes as she begins to make reckless choices in the face of oncoming death. These include kicking her husband out of the house, spending money on an expensive car, and having an affair. She befriends Andrea, a mouthy student in her summer English class. Desperate to make sure her teenage son is on the right path before she die\n\n...

Maureen Ryan of [TV](AOL)(AOL TV) stated that \"Having a character and her family deal with a potentially fatal illness is such a rich arena for both drama and black comedy, but so far, *The Big C* hasn't been able to mine that topic with consistent freshness and depth.\" Ken Tucker of *[Weekly](Entertainment)(Entertainment Weekly)* was critical towards the show, but commended the acting, stating that \"Much of *The Big C*'s unoriginal dramatization of cancer concerns is mitigated by the fresh, dynamic performances of Laura Linney and Oliver Platt.\"\n\nThe third season received a score of 65 on Metacritic based on reviews from 4 critics.\n\nThe fourth and final seasonconsisting of four hour-long episodes received a score of 73 on [Metacritic](Metacritic) based on reviews from 10 critics.\n\n## Awards and nominations\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n*\n\n[American television series debuts](Category:2010)(Category:2010 American television series debuts)\n\n[American comedy-drama television series](Category:2010s)(Category:2010s American comedy-drama television series)\n\n[American television series endings](Category:2013)(Category:2013 American television series endings)\n\n[disorder in fiction](Category:Bipolar)(Category:Bipolar disorder in fiction)\n\n[television shows](Category:English-language)(Category:English-language television shows)\n\n[Emmy Award-winning television series](Category:Primetime)(Category:Primetime Emmy Award-winning television series)\n\n[drama television series](Category:Serial)(Category:Serial drama television series)\n\n[(TV network) original programming](Category:Showtime)(Category:Showtime (TV network) original programming)\n\n[series about cancer](Category:Television)(Category:Television series about cancer)\n\n[series by Sony Pictures Television](Category:Television)(Category:Television series by Sony Pictures Television)\n\n[shows filmed in Connecticut](Category:Television)(Category:Television shows filmed in Connecticut)\n\n[shows set in Minnesota](Category:Television)(Category:Television shows set in Minnesota)\n\n[Academy Honors winners](Category:Television)(Category:Television Academy Honors winners)\n\n</python_output>"

In his 2010 autobiography, *The Happiest Refugee'', Do tells of how his family survived five days in a leaky fishing boat nine and a half metres long and two metres wide. During the trip his family and the rest of the passengers were attacked by two different bands of pirates. The first group stole one of the two engines and the second group of pirates stole the second engine, which had been broken but repaired by Do's father using a piece of rubber from a [ thong](flip-flops ). It was reported that as the second band of pirates left, one of them threw a gallon of water onboard which kept all but one of the refugees alive, until they were finally rescued by a German merchant ship. The boat was packed with 40 [refugees](Vietnamese)(Vietnamese Australians) fleeing across the Indian Ocean. \"We were cramme\n\n...

Major adult BMI classifications are underweight (under 18.5&nbsp;kg/m2), normal weight (18.5 to 24.9), overweight (25 to 29.9), and obese (30 or more).  When used to predict an individual's health, rather than as a statistical measurement for groups, the BMI has [limitations](#Limitations) that can make it less useful than some of the [alternatives](#Alternatives), especially when applied to individuals with [obesity](abdominal)(abdominal obesity), [stature](short)(short stature), or [high muscle mass](unusually)(Bodybuilding).\n\nBMIs under 20 and over 25 have been associated with higher all-cause mortality, with the risk increasing with distance from the 20\u201325 range.\n\n## History\n\n[[& BMI.png|thumb|Obesity and BMI](File:Obesity)]\n\n[Quetelet](Adolphe)(Adolphe Quetelet), a Belgian [astronomer](astronomer), mathematician, [statistician](statistician), and [sociologist](sociologist), devised the basis of the BMI between 1830 and 1850 as he developed what he called \"social physics\".
