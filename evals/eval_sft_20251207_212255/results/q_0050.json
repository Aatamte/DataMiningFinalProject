Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London.

If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2"

McCahill opined, \"Its briny pulp \u2013 dredged from Frank Sch\u00e4tzing\u2019s 2004 novel, preys heavily on viewer fears of ecological collapse, and what might be lurking for us all beneath the planet\u2019s watery depths\".\n\nThe series featured in the list of six international dramas to watch in 2023, published by [Hollywood](Deadline)(Deadline Hollywood).\n\nOliver Armknecht reviewing for film-rezensionen.de graded the series 5 out of 10, criticised the visuals and opined that there was not much to do for the ensemble. In conclusion  Armknecht wrote, \"The global threat can only be felt in a few places, If you don't know the story, you may be surprised at the strange occurrences, at least at first - especially since some maritime attacks are really perfidious.\"\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n*\n\n* [*The Swarm*](https://www.berlinale.de/en/2023/programme/202313662.html) at Berlinale\n\n* [*The Swarm*](https://cineuropa.org/film/438605/) at Cineuropa\n\n* [*The Swarm*](https://www.zdf.de/serien/der-schwarm) at ZDF in\n\n*\n\n[German television series debuts](Category:2023)(Category:2023 German television series debuts)\n\n[television shows](Category:German-language)(Category:German-language television shows)\n\n[television shows](Category:English-language)(Category:English-language television shows)\n\n[shows based on German novels](Category:Television)(Category:Television shows based on German novels)\n\n[original programming](Category:ZDF)(Category:ZDF original programming)\n\n[science fiction television series](Category:German)(Category:German science fiction television series)\n\n</python_output>"
