The BMI is defined as the [mass](body)(human body weight) divided by the [square](square (algebra)) of the [height](body)(human height), and is expressed in [units](Units of measurement) of kg/m2, resulting from mass in [kilogram](kilogram)s and height in [metre](metre)s.\n\nThe BMI may be determined using a table}} or [chart](chart) which displays BMI as a function of mass and height using contour lines or colours for different BMI categories, and which may use other units of measurement (converted to [units](metric)(Metric system) for the calculation).}}\n\nThe BMI is a convenient [of thumb](rule)(rule of thumb) used to broadly categorize a person as *underweight*, *normal weight*, *overweight*, or *obese* based on tissue mass ([muscle](muscle), fat, and bone) and height. Major adult BMI classifications are underweight (under 18.5&nbsp;kg/m2), normal weight (18.5 to 24.9), overweight (25 to 29.9), and obese (30 or more).  When used to predict an individual's health, rather than as a statistical measurement for groups, the BMI has [limitations](#Limitations) that can make it less useful than some of the [alternatives](#Alternatives), especially when applied to individuals with [obesity](abdominal)(abdominal obesity), [stature](short)(short stature), or [high muscle mass](unusually)(Bodybuilding).\n\nBMIs under 20 and over 25 have been associated with higher all-cause mortality, with the risk increasing with distance from the 20\u201325 range.\n\n## History\n\n[[& BMI.png|thumb|Obesity and BMI](File:Obesity)]\n\n[Quetelet](Adolphe)(Adolphe Quetelet), a Belgian [astronomer](astronomer), mathematician, [statistician](statistician), and [sociologist](sociologist), devised the basis of the BMI between 1830 and 1850 as he developed what he called \"social physics\". Quetelet himself never intended for the index, then called the Quetelet Index, to be used as a means of medical assessment. Instead, it was a component of his study of l'homme moyen, or the average man. Que\n\n...

Data on 11,808 subjects from the National Health and Human Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) 1999\u20132004, showed that SBSI outperformed BMI, waist circumference, and [Body Shape Index (ABSI)](A)(Body Shape Index), an alternative to BMI.
