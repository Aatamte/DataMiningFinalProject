Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London. He studied English literature at University College London while making films. His early work...\n</python_output>\n\n<answer>University College London</answer>\n\nRULES:\n1. If search returns empty, try different keywords\n2. Use view_sections() to find specific sections in large pages\n3. You MUST give <answer> by turn 2"

The series format was based directly on [BBC's](British Broadcasting Corporation) *[MasterChef](MasterChef (UK TV series))* and lasted 28 episodes over two seasons. It was hosted by British chef [Rhodes](Gary)(Gary Rhodes), who hosted the UK version of *MasterChef* in 2001.\n\n## Kitchenware\n\nIn 2011, [Productions](Reveille)(Reveille Productions) and [TV](Shine)(Shine TV), announced licensing deals with kitchenware manufacturers The Cookware Company, Triple Loop Housewares, [Knives](Global)(Global Knives), and [Kidsline](Kidsline) to produce MasterChef-branded cookware, including stainless steel pans, knives, kitchen appliances, and children's cooking sets. The branded products were given to contestants on the television show to use during challenges. The show changed its branding in 2013 to reflect its expanded focus on consumer products in addition to the television shows. In 2018, Shine America hired Brand Central as their licensing agency, and more branded products, including barbecue tools from Unibrands and children's cooking sets from [Cool Toys](Wicked)(Wicked Cool Toys), were announced.\n\n## See also\n\n* *[Junior](MasterChef)(MasterChef Junior)*\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n*\n\n*\n\n[ ](Category:MasterChef (American TV series))\n\n[American television series debuts](Category:2010)(Category:2010 American television series debuts)\n\n[television shows](Category:English-language)(Category:English-language television shows)\n\n[Broadcasting Company original programming](Category:Fox)(Category:Fox Broadcasting Company original programming)\n\n[Category:MasterChef](Category:MasterChef)\n\n[series by Reveille Productions](Category:Television)(Category:Television series by Reveille Productions)\n\n[series by All3Media](Category:Television)(Category:Television series by All3Media)\n\n[shows featuring audio description](Category:Television)(Category:Television shows featuring audio description)\n\n[competitions in the United States](Category:Cooking)(Category:Cooking competitions in the United States)\n\n[American cooking television series](Category:2010s)(Category:2010s American cooking television series)\n\n</python_output>"
