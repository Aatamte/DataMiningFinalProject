One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London.

It was co-created by rapper/comedian [Burd](Dave)(Dave Burd) (known by his stage name \"Lil Dicky\"), who plays the titular character, and [Schaffer](Jeff)(Jeff Schaffer). [Hart](Kevin)(Kevin Hart) and [Mottola](Greg)(Greg Mottola) form part of the production team. Lil Dicky's real-life [man](hype)(hype man), [GaTa](GaTa), co-stars as himself. On May 11, 2020, the series was renewed for a second season, which premiered on June 16, 2021. On February 17, 2022, FXX renewed the series for a third season which premiered on April 5, 2023.\n\n## Premise\n\nThe series stars a fictionalized version of [Dicky](Lil)(Lil Dicky), a suburban neurotic man in his late twenties who has convinced himself that he's destined to be one of the best rappers of all time.\n\n## Cast\n\n### Main\n\n* [Burd](Dave)(Dave Burd) as himself, an aspiring rapper from suburban [Philadelphia](Philadelphia)\n\n* Taylor Misiak as Ally Wernick, a kindergarten teacher, Dave's girlfriend and later ex-girlfriend\n\n* [GaTa](GaTa) as himself, Dave's on-stage [man](hype)(hype man) and a rapper himself, who lives with [disorder](bipolar)(bipolar disorder)\n\n* [Santino](Andrew)(Andrew Santino) as Mike, Dave's roommate and later manager\n\n* Travis \"Taco\" Bennett of [Future](Odd)(Odd Future) as Elliot \"Elz\", Dave's childhood friend, a sound engineer, producer, and DJ\n\n* [Ko](Christine)(Christine Ko) as Emma Wu, Ally's roommate and friend, and Dave's graphic designer\n\n### Recurring\n\n* [Hecht](Gina)(Gina Hecht) as Carol Burd, Dave's mom\n\n* [Paymer](David)(David Paymer) as Don Burd, Dave's dad\n\n* Carlease Burke as Catherine Ganter, GaTa\u2019s adoptive mom\n\n* [Blanco](Benny)(Benny Blanco) as\n\n...

Reviewers noted the expansion of the series' sources of humor, its dedication to character development, and improved emotional depth. At the end of its first season, *Dave* averaged 5.32 million viewers per episode, making it the most popular comedy in FX's history. It was renewed for a second season in May 2020.\n\nWhile most of the characters and actors have been praised, the \"Lil Dicky\" character in the show has been negatively received. Many reviewers have noted that while the character's success is the center of the show, his poor treatment of his friends makes him difficult to root for. Additionally, the first season has been criticized for exploring and idealizing fame over art. Daniel D'Addario of [Variety](Variety (magazine)) unfavorably compared the show to *[Atlanta](Atlanta (TV series))*, another entry from [FX](FX (TV channel)). D'Addario states \"When [Glover](Donald)(Donald Glover) made an FX show about characters trying to break into the music industry, it was 'Atlanta,' among the most expansive, richly imaginative shows of the century so far. When Lil Dicky does it, it's a show whose breaks from flatly telling us about his character's private parts tend to follow a linear trajectory: Lil Dicky, a ditherer with more zeal for fame than true creative ambition, ends up trying something, it goes viral, everyone loves it.\"\n\n## Accolades\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n*  \u2013 official site\n\n*\n\n*\n\n[American sitcoms](Category:2020s)(Category:2020s American sitcoms)\n\n[American television series debuts](Category:2020)(Category:2020 American television series debuts)\n\n[television shows](Category:English-language)(Category:English-language television shows)\n\n[original programming](Category:FXX)(Category:FXX original programming)\n\n[series by 20th Century Fox Television](Category:Television)(Category:Television series by 20th Century Fox Television)\n\n[series based on singers and musicians](Category:Television)(Category:Television series based on singers and musicians)\n\n</python_output>"
