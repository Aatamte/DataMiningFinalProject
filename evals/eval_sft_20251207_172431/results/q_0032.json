Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London.

The underlying concept is to use [randomness](randomness) to solve problems that might be [deterministic](deterministic system) in principle. They are often used in [physical](physics) and [mathematical](mathematics) problems and are most useful when it is difficult or impossible to use other approaches. Monte Carlo methods are mainly used in three problem classes: [optimization](optimization), [integration](numerical)(numerical integration), and generating draws from a [distribution](probability)(probability distribution).\n\nIn physics-related problems, Monte Carlo methods are useful for simulating systems with many [coupled](coupling (physics)) [of freedom](degrees)(degrees of freedom), such as fluids, disordered materials, strongly coupled solids, and cellular structures (see [Potts model](cellular)(cellular Potts model), [particle systems](interacting)(interacting particle systems), [process](McKean\u2013Vlasov)(McKean\u2013Vlasov process)es, [models of gases](kinetic)(kinetic theory of gases)).\n\nOther examples include modeling phenomena with significant [uncertainty](uncertainty) in inputs such as the calculation of [risk](risk) in business and, in mathematics, evaluation of multidimensional [integral](definite)(Integral)s with complicated [conditions](boundary)(boundary conditions). In application to systems engineering problems (space, [exploration](oil)(oil exploration), aircraft design, etc.), Monte Carlo&ndash;based predictions of failure, [overrun](cost)(cost overrun)s and schedule overruns are routinely better than human intuition or alternative \"soft\" methods.\n\nIn principle, Monte Carlo methods can be used to solve any problem having a probabilistic interpretation. By the [of large numbers](law)(law of large numbers), integrals described by the [value](expected)(expected value) of some random variable can be approximated by taking the [mean](empirical)(Sample mean and sample covariance) ( the 'sample mean') of independent samples of the variable.
