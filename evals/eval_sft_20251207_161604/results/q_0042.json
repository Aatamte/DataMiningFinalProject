Write code in <python> tags, final answer in <answer> tags.\n\nFUNCTIONS:\n- search_pages(query: str) -> list[dict] with {page_id, title, similarity}\n- view_sections(page_id: str) -> list[dict] with {section_id, section_name}\n- read_section(section_id: str) -> str  (use \"page_id:full\" for entire page)\n\nAlso available: re, json, string, Counter, defaultdict.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n1. One script per turn - do as much as you can in it\n2. Don't stop at first result - check multiple pages/sections\n3. Accumulate findings as you go, print summary at end\n4. If first approach fails, try different queries in the same script\n5. Use Python logic (loops, regex, filtering) to find and extract answers\n6. The answer might be anywhere - search creatively, not just the obvious query\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nQuestion: What university did the director of Inception attend?\n\n<python>\n# Adjust these as needed\nNUM_RESULTS = 3\nCONTEXT_BEFORE = 100\nCONTEXT_AFTER = 400\n\n# Find the film and look for director info\nfor r in search_pages(\"Inception film\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    idx = content.lower().find('directed by')\n    if idx != -1:\n        print(f\"=== {r['title']} ===\")\n        print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n        break\n\n# Search for director's education, find relevant context\nfor r in search_pages(\"Christopher Nolan biography\")[:NUM_RESULTS]:\n    content = read_section(r['page_id'] + \":full\")\n    for keyword in ['university', 'studied', 'college']:\n        idx = content.lower().find(keyword)\n        if idx != -1:\n            print(f\"\\n=== Found '{keyword}' in {r['title']} ===\")\n            print(content[max(0,idx-CONTEXT_BEFORE):idx+CONTEXT_AFTER])\n            break\n</python>\n<python_output>\n=== Inception (film) ===\n...a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife...\n\n=== Found 'university' in Christopher Nolan ===\n...born on 30 July 1970 in Westminster, London.

According to [News](NBC)(NBC News):\n\nThe Epoch Media Group, along with Shen Yun, a dance troupe known for its ubiquitous advertising and unsettling performances, make up the outreach effort of Falun Gong, a relatively new spiritual practice that combines ancient Chinese meditative exercises, mysticism and often ultraconservative cultural worldviews. Falun Gong's founder has referred to Epoch Media Group as \"our media\", and the group's practice heavily informs *The Epoch Times* coverage, according to former employees who spoke with NBC News.\n\n*The Epoch Times*, digital production company NTD and the heavily advertised dance troupe Shen Yun make up the nonprofit network that Li calls \"our media.\" Financial documents paint a complicated picture of more than a dozen technically separate organizations that appear to share missions, money and executives. Though the source of their revenue is unclear, the most recent financial records from each organization paint a picture of an overall business thriving in the Trump era.\n\n## See also\n\n* [of religion in China](Freedom)(Freedom of religion in China)\n\n* [rights in China](Human)(Human rights in China)\n\n* [of new religious movements](List)(List of new religious movements)\n\n## References\n\n## Bibliography\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n## External links\n\n*\n\n[Gong](Category:Falun)(Category:Falun Gong)\n\n[Category:Meditation](Category:Meditation)\n\n[religious movements](Category:New)(Category:New religious movements)\n\n[Category:Qigong](Category:Qigong)\n\n[Category:Homophobia](Category:Homophobia)\n\n[Category:Creationism](Category:Creationism)\n\n[Category:Pseudoscience](Category:Pseudoscience)\n\n[Category:Anti-communism](Category:Anti-communism)\n\n</python_output>"
