The episode was still shown in other countries. This was not a result of the [Marathon bombing](Boston)(Boston Marathon bombing) as some reports have indicated, but was actually decided just hours beforehand, and was more likely due to the [Hook Elementary School shooting](Sandy)(Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting). Fuller said of the decision, \"With this episode, it wasn't about the graphic imagery or violence. It was the associations that came with the subject matter that I felt would inhibit the enjoyment of the overall episode. It was my own sensitivity... We want to be respectful of the social climate we're in right now\". In lieu of a traditional broadcast, a portion of the episode was broken into a series of [webisode](webisode)s, which was made available through various online media outlets.
