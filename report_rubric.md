CS 6220: Project Final Report
Goals: Practice an important job skill: presenting highlights of your work to others.
Resources:
- Report template on Canvas.
Please submit your solution as a single PDF file on Gradescope (see link in Canvas) by the due date and
time shown there. Each group submits only 1 report, making sure all group members are added to the
submission in Gradescope. In general, treat this like a professional report. There will also be point
deductions if the submission is not neat, e.g., it is poorly formatted. (We want our TAs to spend their
time helping you learn, not fixing messy reports or searching for solutions.)
For late submissions you will lose one point per hour after the deadline. This assignment is worth 100
points and accounts for 5% of your final grade. To encourage early work, you will receive a 10-point
bonus if you submit your solution on or before the early submission deadline stated on Canvas. (Notice
that your total score cannot exceed 100 points, but the extra points would compensate for any
deductions.)
As with all software projects, you must include in the root directory of your project a README file that
briefly describes all the steps necessary to build and execute your project. This description should
include all dependencies. For Python projects, create a file named requirements.txt in the project’s root
directory. Each line in this plain-text file specifies a package name and, if needed, version requirements.
For other programming languages, use their equivalent of this approach. The README file will also be
graded, and you will be able to reuse it on all this semester’s assignments with little modification
(assuming you keep your project layout the same). Instructor and TAs must be able to run your project
following the instructions in your README.
Project Report (100 points, incl. supporting files and source code)
This is it: channel all your hard work into this final report by completing the intermediate report with all
your new results.
Deliverables and Important Notes
Submit the report as a single PDF file per group on Gradescope:
1. Make sure the report uses the provided template. The progress report cannot exceed 3 +
2*team-size pages in 11-point font, e.g., a 2-person team cannot exceed 3+2*2=7 pages. (1 PDF
file)
Make sure the following is linked from your report:
2. Files or Jupyter notebooks containing important results discussed in your report.
3. The project in Github Classroom.
If you want to share large (data) files with instructor and TAs, do not add them to your GitHub project.
Instead, do the following:
• Create a new folder in your Northeastern OneDrive and share it with TAs and instructor, but no
one else.
• In that folder, create a subfolder for each homework.
• Copy into that subfolder the big files you want to share.
• Double-check the sharing settings. (By default, files inherit the top-level folder’s permissions.)
The submission time of your project is the latest timestamp of any of the deliverables included. For the
PDF it is the time reported by Gradescope; for the files on GitHub it is the time the files were pushed to
GitHub, according to GitHub. If you want to keep things simple, do the following:
1. Push/copy all requested files to GitHub and make sure everything is there. (Optional: Create a
release with a version number for this snapshot of your repository.)
2. Submit the report on Gradescope. Open the submitted file to verify everything is okay.
3. Do not push any more changes to the files for this HW on GitHub.
