After he strove \"to crowd in as much counterpoint as possible\" into his Third Symphony,Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, 133. he wrote [chamber](chamber music) works adhering strictly to classical models, including a string sextet, a string quartet in F major (Op. 12) and a quintet for flute, clarinet, horn, bassoon and piano in B-flat. About the quartet and the symphony, Tchaikovsky wrote to his patroness, [von Meck](Nadezhda)(Nadezhda von Meck), that they \"were filled with a host of clever things but&nbsp;... [were] imbued with a dryly pedantic character\". Borodin commented that when he heard the symphony, he kept \"feeling that this is the work of a German *Herr Professor* who has put on his glasses and is about to write *Eine grosse Symphonie in C*\".Zetlin, pp. 303–304.\n\nAccording to Rimsky-Korsakov, the other members of the Five showed little enthusiasm for the symphony, and less still for the quartet. Nor was his public debut as a conductor, at an 1874 charity concert where he led the orchestra in the new symphony, considered favorably by his compatriots. He later wrote that \"they began, indeed, to look down upon me as one on the downward path\". Worse still to Rimsky-Korsakov was the faint praise given by [Rubinstein](Anton)(Anton Rubinstein), a composer opposed to the nationalists' music and philosophy. Rimsky-Korsakov wrote that after Rubinstein heard the quartet, he commented that now Rimsky-Korsakov \"might amount to something\" as a composer.Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, 151. He wrote that Tchaikovsky continued to support him morally, telling him that he fully applauded what Rimsky-Korsakov was doing and admired both his artistic modesty and his strength of character.Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, 157 ft. 30. Privately, Tchaikovsky confided to Nadezhda von Meck, \"Apparently [Rimsky-Korsakov] is now passing through this crisis, and how it will end will be difficult to predict. Either a great master will come out of him, or he will finally become bogged down in contrapuntal tricks\".As quoted in Brown, *Crisis Years*, p. 229.\n\n[[Glinka by Ilya Repin.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A mi\n\n... [6465 chars truncated] ...\n\n(Russian Easter Overture)* specifically for them. He noted that these three works \"show a considerable falling off in the use of contrapuntal devices&nbsp;... [replaced] by a strong and virtuoso development of every kind of figuration which sustains the technical interest of my compositions\".Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, p. 296.\n\nRimsky-Korsakov was asked for advice and guidance not just on the Russian Symphony Concerts, but on other projects through which Belyayev aided Russian composers. \"By force of matters purely musical I turned out to be the head of the Belyayev circle\", he wrote. \"As the head Belyayev, too, considered me, consulting me about everything and referring everyone to me as chief\".Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, p. 288. In 1884 Belyayev set up an annual [prize](Glinka)(Glinka prize), and in 1885 he founded his own music publishing firm, through which he published works by Borodin, Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov at his own expense. To select which composers to assist with money, publication or performances from the many who now appealed for help, Belyayev set up an advisory council made up of Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov. They would look through the compositions and appeals submitted and suggest which composers were deserving of patronage and public attention.Maes, p. 173.\n\nThe group of composers who now congregated with Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov became known as the [circle](Belyayev)(Belyayev circle), named after their financial benefactor. These composers were nationalistic in their musical outlook, as The Five before them had been. Like The Five, they believed in a uniquely Russian style of classical music that utilized folk music and exotic melodic, harmonic and rhythmic elements, as exemplified by the music of Balakirev, Borodin and Rimsky-Korsakov. Unlike The Five, these composers also believed in the necessity of an academic, Western-based background in composition—which Rimsky-Korsakov had instilled in his years at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory.Maes, p. 192. Compared to the \"revolutionary\" composers in Balakirev's circle, Rimsky-Korsakov found those in the Belyayev circle to be \"progressive&nbsp;... attaching as it did great importance to technical perfection, but&nbsp;... also broke new paths, though more securely, even if less speedily&nbsp;...\"Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, pp. 286–287.\n\n\n</python_output>"}
