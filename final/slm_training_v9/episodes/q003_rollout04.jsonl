Springfield, MA: Merriam-Webster, 1961, rev. 2016. He used the term to refer to the case of a young boy who had severe difficulty learning to read and write, despite showing typical intelligence and physical abilities in all other respects. In 1896, W. Pringle Morgan, a British physician from [East Sussex](Seaford,)(Seaford, East Sussex), published a description of a reading-specific learning disorder in a report to the *[Medical Journal](British)(British Medical Journal)* titled \"Congenital Word Blindness\". The distinction between phonological versus surface types of dyslexia is only descriptive, and without any etiological assumption as to the underlying brain mechanisms. However, studies have alluded to potential differences due to variation in performance. Over time, we have changed from the intelligence-based model to the age-based model, in terms of those with Dyslexia.\n\n\n</python_output>"}
