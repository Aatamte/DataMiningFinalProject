{"type": "execution", "content": "<python_output>\n## Etymology\n\nThe term *Khmers rouges*, [French](French language) for [red](Political colour#Red) [Khmers](Khmer people), was coined by King Norodom Sihanouk and later adopted by English speakers (in the form of the corrupted version Khmer Rouge). It was used to refer to a succession of communist parties in Cambodia which evolved into the Communist Party of Kampuchea and later the [of Democratic Kampuchea](Party)(Party of Democratic Kampuchea). Its military was known successively as the [Revolutionary Army](Kampuchean)(Kampuchean Revolutionary Army) and the [Army of Democratic Kampuchea](National)(National Army of Democratic Kampuchea).\n\nSince the serious deterioration in relations between [Republic of Vietnam](Socialist)(Socialist Republic of Vietnam) and [Kampuchea](Democratic)(Democratic Kampuchea), the [communism](Vietnamese)(Communist Party of Vietnam) authority no longer recognize the legitimacy of Khmer Rouge, and calls it **Pol Pot-Ieng Sary group** () or **Pol Pot-Ieng Sary reactionary group** ().\n\n\n</python_output>"}
