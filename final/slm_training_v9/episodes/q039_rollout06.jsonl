In 2005, Erdoğan and the [opposition](main)(Republican People's Party) party leader [Baykal](Deniz)(Deniz Baykal) wrote a letter to [of Armenia](President)(President of Armenia) [Kocharyan](Robert)(Robert Kocharyan), proposing the creation of a joint Turkish-Armenian commission. Armenian Foreign Minister [Oskanian](Vartan)(Vartan Oskanian) rejected the offer because he asserted that the proposal itself was \"insincere and not serious\". He added: \"This issue cannot be considered at historical level with Turks, who themselves politicized the problem.\"\n\nIn December 2008, Erdoğan criticized the [Apologize campaign](I)(I Apologize campaign) by Turkish intellectuals to recognize the Armenian genocide, saying, \"I neither accept nor support this campaign. We did not commit a crime, therefore we do not need to apologise&nbsp;... It will not have any benefit other than stirring up trouble, disturbing our peace and undoing the steps which have been taken.\"\n\n[[File:Monument to Humanity by Mehmet Aksoy in Kars, Turkey.jpg|thumbnail|250px|In 2011, Erdoğan called the  Monument to Humanity, a statue dedicated to fostering Armenian and Turkish relations, \"freakishly ugly\" ([Turkish](Turkish language): *ucube*) and ordered it to be demolished. Erdoğan was subsequently fined by a Turkish judge for insulting the work and the creator was compensated due to the \"violation of the freedom of expression\".]]\n\nIn 2011, Erdoğan ordered the tearing-down of the  *[to Humanity](Monument)(Monument to Humanity)*, a Turkish–Armenian friendship monument in [Kars](Kars), which was commissioned in 2006 and represented a metaphor of the rapprochement of the two countries after many years of dispute over the events of 1915. Erdoğan justified the removal by stating that the monument was offensively close to the tomb of an 11th-century Islamic scholar, and that its shadow ruined the view of that site, while Kars municipality officials said it was illegally erected in a protected area. However, the former mayor of Kars who approved the original construction of the monument said the municipality was destroying not just a \"monument to humanity\" but \"humanity itself\". The demolition was not unopposed; among its detractors were several Turkish artists. Two of them, the painter Bedri Baykam and his associate, Pyramid Art Gallery general coordinator Tugba Kurtulmus, were stabbed after a meeting with other artists at the Istanbul Akatlar cultural center.\n\nOn 23 April 2014, Erdoğan's office issued a statement in nine languages (including two dialects of Armenian), offering condolences for the mass killings of Armenians and stating that the events of 1915 had inhumane consequences. The statement described the mass killings as the two nations' shared pain and said: \"Having experienced events which had inhumane consequences – such as relocation – during the First World War, (it) should not prevent Turks and Armenians from establishing compassion and mutually humane attitudes among  one another.\"\n\n[Francis](Pope)(Pope Francis) in April 2015, at a special [mass](Mass in the Catholic Church) in [Peter's Basilica](St.)(St. Peter's Basilica) marking the centenary of the events, described atrocities against Armenian civilians in 1915–1922 as \"the first genocide of the 20th century\". In protest, Erdoğan recalled the Turkish ambassador from the Vatican, and summoned the Vatican's ambassador, to express \"disappointment\" at what he called a discriminatory message. He later stated \"we don't carry a stain or a shadow like genocide\". US President [Obama](Barack)(Barack Obama) called for a \"full, frank and just acknowledgement of the facts\", but again stopped short of labelling it \"genocide\", despite his campaign promise to do so.\n\n\n</python_output>"}
