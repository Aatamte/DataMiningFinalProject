Older structures were again reused, including Troy&nbsp;VI's citadel walls. Its first phase, Troy&nbsp;VIIb1, appears to be largely a continuation of Troy&nbsp;VIIa. Residents continued using wheel-made Grey Ware pottery alongside a new handmade style sometimes known as \"barbarian ware\". Imported Mycenaean-style pottery attests to some continuing foreign trade. However, the city's population appears to have dropped, and rebuilding seems to be confined to the citadel.\n\nOne of the most striking finds from Troy&nbsp;VIIb1 is a [Luwian](hieroglyphic)(hieroglyphic Luwian) seal giving the names of a woman and a man who worked as a scribe. The seal is important since it is the only example of preclassical writing found at the site, and provides potential evidence that Troy&nbsp;VIIb1 had a [Luwian](Luwian language)-speaking population. However, the find is puzzling since palace bureaucracies had largely disappeared by this era. Proposed explanations include the possibility that it belonged to an itinerant freelance scribe and alternatively that it dates from an earlier era than its find context would suggest.\n\nTroy&nbsp;VIIb2 is marked by dramatic cultural changes including walls made of upright stones and a handmade knobbed pottery style known as *Buckelkeramik*. These practices, which existed alongside older local traditions, have been argued to reflect immigrant populations arriving from southwest Europe. These newcomers may have shared an origin with the [Phrygians](Phrygians) who initiated similar cultural shifts at sites such as [Gordion](Gordion). This layer was destroyed around 1050 BC after an apparent earthquake.\n\nTroy&nbsp;VIIb3 dates from the [Protogeometric](Protogeometric) era. No new builds were constructed, so its existence is known primarily from artifacts found in the West Sanctuary and terraces on south side of mound. These areas were excavated in the 1990s, surprising the archaeologists who had assumed that the site was abandoned until the Archaic Era. Locally made neck-handled [amphora](amphora)s shows that Troy still had a pottery industry, possibly associated with a wine or oil industry. The style of these pots shows stylistic similarities to other North Aegean sites, suggesting cultural contact. (Because other artifacts do not show these links, archaeologists believe that Greek settlement of Troy did not begin until later.) Both the Troy VI walls and the Troy VIIa Terrace House were reused for worship and communal feasting, as evidenced by animal bones, pottery assemblages, and traces of burned incense. Strikingly, the Terrace House was not renovated when it was adopted as a cult center and thus must have been used in a ruined state, potentially suggesting that the occupants of Troy VIIb3 were deliberately re-engaging with their past.\n\nTroy&nbsp;VIIb was destroyed by fire around 950&nbsp;BC. However, some houses in the citadel were left intact and the site continued to be occupied, if only sparsely.\n\n\n</python_output>"}
