{"type": "execution", "content": "<python_output>\n### Texan Independence\n\nLittle is certain about Glanton's youth, but he apparently developed a reputation for explosive violence. He appears in few records until his 1841 arrest in Louisiana but later authors state he fled [Tennessee](Tennessee) as an [outlaw](outlaw) before settling in [Gonzales](Gonzales, Texas), [Texas](Mexican Texas), and taking part in the [battle](first)(Battle of Gonzales) of the 1835 [Revolution](Texian)(Texian Revolution) against [Mexico](Mexico)'s [Republic](Centralist)(Centralist Republic of Mexico). A fiancée was [abducted](Captives in American Indian Wars), [scalped](scalping), and killed by [Apaches](Lipan)(Lipan Apaches) before or during his time with [F. Austin](Stephen)(Stephen F. Austin) at the [siege](Siege of Béxar) of [Cos](De)(Martín Perfecto de Cos)'s forces in [Antonio](San)(San Antonio, Texas). He was said to have been a scout under [Fannin](Col.James)(James Fannin), commissioned as a captain of the [Rangers](Texas)(Texas Ranger Division) while still 16, and to have narrowly escaped [La Portilla](De)(José Nicolás de la Portilla)'s 27 March 1836 [massacre](Goliad Massacre) of Fannin's men at [Goliad](Goliad, Texas). After the [of San Jacinto](Battle)(Battle of San Jacinto), [President](President of the Republic of Texas) [Houston](Sam)(Sam Houston) supposedly banished Glanton from Texas, although this was never enforced and no record of such an order survives. He was later said to have wounded or killed the best men on both sides of the [War](Regulator–Moderator)(Regulator–Moderator War) without supporting either side himself.\n\nGlanton was arrested in [Orleans](New)(New Orleans) on 11 March 1841 for [assault](assault), having tried to shoot a [officer](police)(New Orleans Police Department) with his pistol in the [Theatre](American)(New American Theatre), but he was dismissed with little or no punishment since no one was hurt. In early 1843, Glanton applied for a 320 [acre](acre) [grant](land grant) of land in Jackson County, Arkansas. He improved the land but, receiving no certificate of purchase, he transferred his claim to his brother Benjamin in 1845 and returned to Louisiana. He was still receiving his mail in New Orleans in September 1846 but had apparently already left for Texas.\n\n\n</python_output>"}
