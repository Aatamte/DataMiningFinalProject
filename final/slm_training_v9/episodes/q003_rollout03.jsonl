Different people are affected to different degrees. Problems may include difficulties in [spelling](spelling) words, reading quickly, [words](writing)(handwriting), \"sounding out\" words [the head](in)(Subvocalization), pronouncing words when reading aloud and understanding what one reads. Often these difficulties are first noticed at school. The difficulties are involuntary, and people with this disorder have a normal desire to [learn](learn). People with dyslexia have higher rates of [deficit hyperactivity disorder](attention)(attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) (ADHD), [language disorder](developmental)(developmental language disorder)s, and [with numbers](difficulties)(dyscalculia).\n\nDyslexia is believed to be caused by the [interaction](Gene–environment interaction) of [genetic](Genetics) and environmental factors. Some cases run in families. Dyslexia that develops due to a [brain injury](traumatic)(traumatic brain injury), [stroke](stroke), or [dementia](dementia) is sometimes called \"acquired dyslexia\" or **alexia**. The underlying mechanisms of dyslexia result from differences within [brain's language processing](the)(language processing in the brain). Dyslexia is diagnosed through a series of tests of memory, vision, spelling, and reading skills. Dyslexia is separate from reading difficulties caused by [hearing](hearing problems) or [problem](vision)(vision problem)s or by insufficient [teaching](Reading education) or opportunity to learn.\n\nTreatment involves adjusting teaching methods to meet the person's needs. While not curing the underlying problem, it may decrease the degree or impact of symptoms. Treatments targeting vision are not effective. Dyslexia is the most common [disability](learning)(learning disability) and occurs in all areas of the world. It affects 3–7% of the population; however, up to 20% of the general population may have some degree of symptoms.  While dyslexia is more often diagnosed in boys, this is partly explained by a self-fulfilling [bias](referral)(Selection bias#Sampling bias) among teachers and professionals.[Arnett, A. B., Pennington, B. F., Peterson, R. L., Willcutt, E. G., DeFries, J. C., & Olson, R. K. (2017).\n\n... [27644 chars truncated] ...\n\n to be successful for most children with a diagnosis of dyslexia, without first requiring the families to obtain an official diagnosis, dyslexia advocates and parents of children with dyslexia were fearful that they were losing a privileged status.\n\n### Stigma and success\n\nDue to the various cognitive processes that dyslexia affects and the overwhelming societal stigma around the disability, individuals with dyslexia often employ behaviors of self-stigma and perfectionistic self-presentation in order to cope with their disability. The perfectionist self-presentation is when an individual attempts to present themselves as the perfect ideal image and hides any imperfections. This behavior presents serious risk as it often results in mental health issues and refusal to seek help for their disability.\n\n## Research\n\n[[Systems Template Image.svg|thumb|120px|Writing systems](File:Writing)]\n\nMost dyslexia research relates to [writing system](alphabetic)(alphabetic writing system)s, and especially to [languages](European)(European languages). However, substantial research is also available regarding people with dyslexia who speak Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew, or other languages. The outward expression of individuals with reading disability, and regular poor readers, is the same in some respects.\n\n## See also\n\n* [Dyscalculia](Dyscalculia), difficulty comprehending numbers and math\n\n* [to read](Learning)(Learning to read)\n\n* [Orton-Gillingham](Orton-Gillingham)\n\n* [of people with dyslexia](List)(List of people with dyslexia)\n\n## References\n\n## Further reading\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n## External links\n\n(developmental),\n\n|ICD9 =\n\n|ICDO =\n\n|OMIM = 127700\n\n|MedlinePlus = 001406\n\n|eMedicineSubj =article\n\n|eMedicineTopic =1835801\n\n|MeshID = D004410\n\n|Scholia = Q132971\n\n}}\n\n}}\n\n[ ](Category:Dyslexia)\n\n[Category:Literacy](Category:Literacy)\n\n[to read](Category:Learning)(Category:Learning to read)\n\n[developmental disorders](Category:Specific)(Category:Specific developmental disorders)\n\n[*Dyslexia](Category:Reading (process))\n\n[medicine articles ready to translate](Category:Wikipedia)(Category:Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate)\n\n[neurology articles ready to translate](Category:Wikipedia)(Category:Wikipedia neurology articles ready to translate)\n\n[education](Category:Special)(Category:Special education)\n\n[Category:Writing](Category:Writing)\n\n</python_output>"}
