The channel was first tested on December 1, 1977, as an experimental local channel in Columbus, Ohio. On April 1, 1979, the channel expanded into a national network named Nickelodeon.\n\nThe first program broadcast on Nickelodeon was *[Pinwheel](Pinwheel (TV series))*, a preschool series created by Dr. Vivian Horner, who also conceived the idea for the channel itself. At its launch, Nickelodeon was commercial-free and mainly featured educational shows. By 1984, the channel began accepting traditional commercials and introduced more entertainment-focused programming. In January 1988, the network launched a weekday morning block for preschoolers called [Jr.](Nick)(Nick Jr. (TV programming block)), which carried *Pinwheel* and other educational series. Around the same time, Nickelodeon began investing in original animated shows, which premiered in 1991 under the \"[Nicktoons](Nicktoons)\" branding. Since then, the channel has consistently aired a mix of original live-action and animated titles.\n\n## Current programming\n\n### Original programming\n\n#### Animated (\"Nicktoons\")\n\n#### Live-action\n\n##### Comedy\n\n##### Drama\n\n##### Game shows\n\n##### News and sports\n\n#### Preschool series\n\n#### Specials\n\n#### Educational series\n\n### Acquired programming\n\n#### Animated\n\n#### Preschool series\n\n## Upcoming programming\n\n### Original programming\n\n#### Animated (\"Nicktoons\")\n\n#### Preschool series\n\n### Acquired programming\n\n#### Animated series\n\n#### Preschool series\n\n## Former programming\n\n### Original programming\n\n#### Animated (\"[Nicktoons](Nicktoons)\")\n\n#### Live-action\n\n##### Comedy\n\n##### Drama\n\n##### Game shows\n\n##### Variety programs\n\n#### Preschool\n\n##### Animated preschool series\n\n##### Live-action preschool series\n\n#### Programming from [Noggin](Noggin (brand))\n\n#### Mini-series/other\n\n### Former acquired programming\n\n#### Former acquired animated series\n\n**[6teen](6teen)* (2005–06)\n\n**[Ventura: Pet Detective](Ace)(Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (TV series))* (1999–2000)\n\n**[Adventures of The Little Prince](The)(The Adventures of the Little Prince (TV series))* (1\n\n...
