In 2005, Erdoğan and the [opposition](main)(Republican People's Party) party leader [Baykal](Deniz)(Deniz Baykal) wrote a letter to [of Armenia](President)(President of Armenia) [Kocharyan](Robert)(Robert Kocharyan), proposing the creation of a joint Turkish-Armenian commission. Armenian Foreign Minister [Oskanian](Vartan)(Vartan Oskanian) rejected the offer because he asserted that the proposal itself was \"insincere and not serious\". He added: \"This issue cannot be considered at historical level with Turks, who themselves politicized the problem.\"\n\nIn December 2008, Erdoğan criticized the [Apologize campaign](I)(I Apologize campaign) by Turkish intellectuals to recognize the Armenian genocide, saying, \"I neither accept nor support this campaign. We did not commit a crime, therefore we do not need to apologise&nbsp;... It will not have any benefit other than stirring up trouble, disturbing our peace and undoing the steps which have been taken.\"\n\n[[File:Monument to Humanity by Mehmet Aksoy in Kars, Turkey.jpg|thumbnail|250px|In 2011, Erdoğan called the  Monument to Humanity, a statue dedicated to fostering Armenian and Turkish relations, \"freakishly ugly\" ([Turkish](Turkish language): *ucube*) and ordered it to be demolished. Erdoğan was subsequently fined by a Turkish judge for insulting the work and the creator was compensated due to the \"violation of the freedom of expression\".]]\n\nIn 2011, Erdoğan ordered the tearing-down of the  *[to Humanity](Monument)(Monument to Humanity)*, a Turkish–Armenian friendship monument in [Kars](Kars), which was commissioned in 2006 and represented a metaphor of the rapprochement of the two countries after many years of dispute over the events of 1915. Erdoğan justified the removal by stating that the monument was offensively close to the tomb of an 11th-century Islamic scholar, and that its shadow ruined the view of that site, while Kars municipality officials said it was illegally erected in a protected area. However, the former mayo\n\n... [3657 chars truncated] ...\n\ntate](Council)(Council of State (Turkey)) annulled the [Cabinet](Cabinet of Turkey)'s 1934 decision to establish the [Sophia](Hagia)(Hagia Sophia) as museum and revoking the monument's status, Erdoğan ordered its reclassification as a mosque. The 1934 decree was ruled to be unlawful under both Ottoman and Turkish law as Hagia Sophia's *[waqf](waqf)*, endowed by [Mehmed II](Sultan)(Mehmed the Conqueror), had designated the site a mosque; proponents of the decision argued the Hagia Sophia was the personal property of the sultan. This redesignation is controversial, invoking condemnation from the Turkish opposition, [UNESCO](UNESCO), the [Council of Churches](World)(World Council of Churches), the [See](Holy)(Holy See), and many other international leaders. In August 2020, he also signed the order that transferred the administration of the [Church](Chora)(Chora Church) to the Directorate of Religious Affairs to open it for worship as a mosque. Initially converted to a mosque by the Ottomans, the building had then been designated as a museum by the government since 1934.\n\nIn August 2020, Erdoğan gave a speech saying that \"in our civilization, conquest is not occupation or looting. It is establishing the dominance of the justice that Allah commanded in the region. First of all, our nation removed the oppression from the areas that it conquered. It established justice. This is why our civilization is one of conquest. Turkey will take what is its right in the Mediterranean Sea, in the Aegean Sea, and in the Black Sea.\" In October 2020, he made a statement before the [National Assembly](Grand)(Grand National Assembly of Turkey) that \"[Jerusalem](Jerusalem) is ours\", referring to the period of Ottoman rule over the city and the rebuilding of its [City](Old)(Old City (Jerusalem)) by [the Magnificent](Suleiman)(Suleiman the Magnificent).\n\n##### Mehmet Aksoy lawsuit\n\nIn 2009, Turkish sculptor [Aksoy](Mehmet)(Mehmet Aksoy (sculptor)) created the *[of Humanity](Statue)(Statue of Humanity)* in [Kars](Kars) to promote reconciliation between Turkey and [Armenia](Armenia). When visiting the city in 2011, Erdoğan deemed the statue a \"freak\", and months later it was demolished. Aksoy sued Erdoğan for \"moral indemnities\", although his lawyer said that his statement was a critique rather than an insult. In March 2015, a judge ordered Erdoğan to pay 10,000 [liras](Turkish lira).\n\n\n</python_output>"}
