Money advanced the use of more accurate terminology in sex research, coining the terms *[role](gender)(gender role)* and *[orientation](sexual)(sexual orientation)*. Despite widespread popular belief, Money did not coin '''gender identity'''. Money pioneered drug treatment for sex offenders in order to extinguish their sex drives. He began testing [anti-androgen](Antiandrogen) medications on offenders as early as 1966, which yielded successful results.\n\nStarting in the 1990s, the work and research conducted by Money has been subjected to significant academic and public scrutiny. A 1997 academic study criticised Money's work in many respects, particularly in regard to the involuntary sex-reassignment of the child [Reimer](David)(David Reimer), and Money's sexual abuse of Reimer and his brother when they were children. Some of Money's sessions involved Money forcing the two children to perform sexual activities with each other, which Money then photographed. David Reimer l\n\n...
