Directed by [Fowler](Jeff)(Jeff Fowler) (in his feature directorial debut) and written by [Casey](Pat)(Patrick Casey (writer)) and [Miller](Josh)(Josh Miller (filmmaker)), it stars [Schwartz](Ben)(Ben Schwartz) as the voice of [the Hedgehog](Sonic)(Sonic the Hedgehog (character)), alongside [Marsden](James)(James Marsden), [Sumpter](Tika)(Tika Sumpter), [Rothwell](Natasha)(Natasha Rothwell), [Pally](Adam)(Adam Pally), [Majdoub](Lee)(Lee Majdoub), [McDonough](Neal)(Neal McDonough), and [Carrey](Jim)(Jim Carrey). The film follows Sonic (voiced by Schwartz), a blue [anthropomorphic](Anthropomorphism) hedgehog who can run at supersonic speeds. He teams up with a town sheriff, Tom Wachowski (Marsden), to stop the mad scientist [Robotnik](Dr.)(Doctor Eggman) (Carrey).\n\nDevelopment for a *Sonic* film began in the 1990s but did not leave the planning stage until [Pictures](Sony)(Sony Pictures) acquired the rights in 2013. Fowler was brought in to direct in 2016. After Sony put the project in [turnaround](Turnaround (filmmaking)), [Pictures](Paramount)(Paramount Pictures) acquired it in 2017. Most of the cast signed on by August 2018, and principal filming took place between September and October that year in [Vancouver](Vancouver) and on [Island](Vancouver)(Vancouver Island). Following the negative reaction to the first trailer's reveal of Sonic's appearance in April of 2019, Paramount delayed the film release by three months, taking five months to redesign Sonic in the meanwhile.\n\n*Sonic the Hedgehog* premiered at the Paramount Pictures studio lot on January 25, 2020, before being theatrically released in the United States on February 14. It set the record for the biggest opening weekend for a [game film](video)(List of films based on video games) in the United States and Canada and grossed  worldwide, becoming the [highest-grossing film of 2020](sixth)(2020 in film#Highest-grossing films), and was the highest-grossing video game film adaptation of all time in North America until 2022, when it was surpassed by its sequel. The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised its action sequences, performances (par\n\n... [15193 chars truncated] ...\n\nect to several studios. Having enjoyed his performance, they officially cast Schwartz as the voice of Sonic. [Pally](Adam)(Adam Pally) and [McDonough](Neal)(Neal McDonough) were added to the cast later that month. Debs Howard and Elfina Luk joined the cast the following November. [Raff](Riff)(Riff Raff (rapper)) was cast in an undisclosed role, but was cut from the film.\n\n### Filming\n\n[photography](Principal)(Principal photography) began in mid-September 2018 and ended in [Vancouver](Vancouver), [Ladysmith](Ladysmith, British Columbia), and [Island](Vancouver)(Vancouver Island) on October 16, 2018. Key production scenes were also filmed in [Oasis](Liwa)(Liwa Oasis), [Arab Emirates](United)(United Arab Emirates). During filming, Ben Schwartz was unavailable, so a stand-in performed alongside Marsden.\n\n### Visual effects and design\n\nThe visual effects are provided by [Picture Company](Moving)(Moving Picture Company) (MPC), [Animation Planet](Marza)(Marza Animation Planet), [Studio](Blur)(Blur Studio), [Trixter](Trixter (company)), and [Domain](Digital)(Digital Domain). The production team created a live-action version of Sonic using [CGI](computer animation), adding fur, new running sneakers, two separate eyes, and a more human like physique. They used Ted, the living teddy bear from the *[Ted](Ted (film))* films, as a reference to insert a CGI character into a real-world setting. Executive producer Miller said: \"It would be weird, and it would feel like he was running around nude if he was some sort of otter-like thing. It was always, for us, fur, and we never considered anything different. It's part of what integrates him into the real world and makes him a real creature.\" According to Miller, Sega was not \"entirely happy\" with the design of Sonic's eyes.\n\nOn May 2, 2019, in response to the criticism, Fowler announced on [Twitter](Twitter) that Sonic would be redesigned. The film was delayed from its original release date of November 8, 2019, to February 14, 2020, as a result. Artist [Hesse](Tyson)(Tyson Hesse), who worked on previous *Sonic the Hedgehog* media, was brought on to lead the redesign. Sonic was given larger and differently colored eyes, new sneakers, white gloves, and a less humanlike body to better resemble *Sonic*s video game design. Sonic was redesigned by Marza Animation Planet. The redesign added an estimated $5 million to the production \n\n</python_output>"}
