After he strove \"to crowd in as much counterpoint as possible\" into his Third Symphony,Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, 133. he wrote [chamber](chamber music) works adhering strictly to classical models, including a string sextet, a string quartet in F major (Op. 12) and a quintet for flute, clarinet, horn, bassoon and piano in B-flat. About the quartet and the symphony, Tchaikovsky wrote to his patroness, [von Meck](Nadezhda)(Nadezhda von Meck), that they \"were filled with a host of clever things but&nbsp;... [were] imbued with a dryly pedantic character\". Borodin commented that when he heard the symphony, he kept \"feeling that this is the work of a German *Herr Professor* who has put on his glasses and is about to write *Eine grosse Symphonie in C*\".Zetlin, pp. 303–304.\n\nAccording to Rimsky-Korsakov, the other members of the Five showed little enthusiasm for the symphony, and less still for the quartet. Nor was his public debut as a conductor, at an 1874 charity concert where he led the orchestra in the new symphony, considered favorably by his compatriots. He later wrote that \"they began, indeed, to look down upon me as one on the downward path\". Worse still to Rimsky-Korsakov was the faint praise given by [Rubinstein](Anton)(Anton Rubinstein), a composer opposed to the nationalists' music and philosophy. Rimsky-Korsakov wrote that after Rubinstein heard the quartet, he commented that now Rimsky-Korsakov \"might amount to something\" as a composer.Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, 151. He wrote that Tchaikovsky continued to support him morally, telling him that he fully applauded what Rimsky-Korsakov was doing and admired both his artistic modesty and his strength of character.Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, 157 ft. 30. Privately, Tchaikovsky confided to Nadezhda von Meck, \"Apparently [Rimsky-Korsakov] is now passing through this crisis, and how it will end will be difficult to predict. Either a great master will come out of him, or he will finally become bogged down in contrapuntal tricks\".As quoted in Brown, *Crisis Years*, p. 229.\n\n[[Glinka by Ilya Repin.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A mi\n\n...

No similar project had been attempted before in Russian music, and guidelines for scholarly musical editing had to be established and agreed. While Balakirev favored making changes in Glinka's music to \"correct\" what he saw as compositional flaws, Rimsky-Korsakov favored a less intrusive approach. Eventually, Rimsky-Korsakov prevailed. \"Work on Glinka's scores was an unexpected schooling for me\", he later wrote. \"Even before this I had known and worshipped his operas; but as editor of the scores in print I had to go through Glinka's style and instrumentation to their last little note&nbsp;... And this was a beneficent discipline for me, leading me as it did to the path of modern music, after my vicissitudes with counterpoint and strict style\".Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, p. 175.\n\nIn mid-1877, Rimsky-Korsakov thought increasingly about the short story *[Night](May)(May Night or the Drowned Maiden)* by [Gogol](Nikolai)(Nikolai Gogol). The story had long been a favorite of his, and his wife Nadezhda had encouraged him to write an opera based on it from the day of their betrothal, when they had read it together.Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, pp. 188–189. While musical ideas for such a work predated 1877, now they came with greater persistence. By early 1878 the project took an increasing amount of his attention; in February he started writing in earnest, and he finished the opera by early November.\n\nRimsky-Korsakov wrote that *[Night](May)(May Night)* was of great importance because, despite the opera's containing a good deal of contrapuntal music, he nevertheless \"*cast off the shackles of counterpoint* [Rimsky-Korsakov](emphasis)\".Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, p. 208. He wrote the opera in a folk-like melodic idiom, and scored it in a transparent manner much in the style of Glinka. Nevertheless, despite the ease of writing this opera and the next, *[Snow Maiden](The)(The Snow Maiden)*,Rimsky-Korsakov, *My Musical Life*, p. 235. from time to time he suffered from creative paralysis between 1881 and 1888. He kept busy during this time by editing Mussorgsky's works and completing Borodin's *[Igor](Prince)(Prince Igor)* (Mussorgsky died in 1881, Borodin in 1887).\n\n\n</python_output>"}
