{"type": "execution", "content": "<python_output>\n#### Troy VIIa\n\nTroy&nbsp;VIIa was the final layer of the Late Bronze Age city. It was built soon after the destruction of Troy&nbsp;VI, seemingly by its previous inhabitants. The builders reused many of the earlier city's surviving structures, notably its citadel wall, which they renovated with additional stone towers and mudbrick breastworks. Numerous small houses were added inside the citadel, filling in formerly open areas. New houses were also built in the lower city, whose area appears to have been greater in Troy&nbsp;VIIa than in Troy&nbsp;VI. In many of these houses, archaeologists found enormous storage jars called [pithoi](pithos) buried in the ground. Troy&nbsp;VIIa seems to have been built by survivors of Troy&nbsp;VI's destruction, as evidenced by continuity in material culture. However, the character of the city appears to have changed, the citadel growing crowded and foreign imports declining.\n\nThe city was destroyed around 1180&nbsp;BC, roughly contemporary with the [Bronze Age collapse](Late)(Late Bronze Age collapse) but subsequent to the [of the Mycenaean palaces](destruction)(Mycenaean Greece#Collapse or postpalatial Bronze Age (c. 1200–1050 BC)). The destruction layer shows evidence of enemy attack, including scorch marks.\n\n\n</python_output>"}
