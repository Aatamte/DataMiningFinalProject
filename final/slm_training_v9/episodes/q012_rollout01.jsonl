Nichols spent most of his adult life in the [Lapeer](Lapeer County, Michigan) and [County](Sanilac)(Sanilac County, Michigan) areas of Michigan where mistrust and resentment of the federal government was common, especially after bank foreclosures of many farms during the 1980s.Stickney, p. 91. Neighbors said he attended meetings of anti-government groups, experimented with explosives and got more radical as time went on.\n\nNichols began to adhere to [citizen](sovereign)(Sovereign citizen movement) ideology. In February 1992, he attempted to [his US citizenship](renounce)(Renunciation of United States citizenship) by writing to the local county clerk in Michigan, stating that the political system was corrupt, and declaring himself a \"non resident alien\". Several months later, he appeared in court and tried to avoid responsibility for some of his credit card bills (he owed approximately $40,000 altogether), refusing to come before the bench, and shouting at the judge that the government had no [jurisdiction](jurisdiction) over him. On October 19, 1992, he signed another document renouncing his US citizenship. In May 1993, Nichols appeared before a county judge regarding an $8,421 unpaid credit card debt. He also renounced his [license](driver’s)(driver’s license).\n\nMcVeigh and Nichols grew closer after McVeigh's discharge from the Army. In December 1991, Nichols invited McVeigh to join him in Michigan and help him out selling military surplus at [show](gun)(gun show)s.Stickney, p. 129. For the next three years, McVeigh stayed with Nichols off and on.Stickney, p. 144. On April 19, 1993, Nichols was watching TV with McVeigh at the Nichols' farmhouse in Michigan during the [of the Branch Davidian compound](siege)(Waco siege) in [Texas](Waco,)(Waco, Texas). When the compound went up in flames, McVeigh and Nichols were enraged and began to plot revenge on the federal government. In the fall of 1993, Nichols and McVeigh, who were living at the farm, became business partners, selling weapons and military surplus at gun shows. For a while, they lived an itinerant life, following the gun shows from town to town.\n\nNichols then went to [Vegas](Las)(Las Vegas Valley) to try working in construction but failed. Next, he went to central Kansas and was hired in March 1994 as a ranch hand in [Kansas](Marion,)(Marion, Kansas). In March 1994, he sent a letter to the clerk of [County, Kansas](Marion)(Marion County, Kansas), saying he was not subject to the laws of the U.S. government and asked his employer not to [withhold](Withholding tax) any federal taxes from his check. His employer said Nichols was hard-working but had unusual political views. In the fall of 1994, Nichols quit his job, telling his employer he was going into business with McVeigh.\n\n\n</python_output>"}
