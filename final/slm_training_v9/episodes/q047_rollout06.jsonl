{"type": "execution", "content": "<python_output>\n### Texan Independence\n\nLittle is certain about Glanton's youth, but he apparently developed a reputation for explosive violence. He appears in few records until his 1841 arrest in Louisiana but later authors state he fled [Tennessee](Tennessee) as an [outlaw](outlaw) before settling in [Gonzales](Gonzales, Texas), [Texas](Mexican Texas), and taking part in the [battle](first)(Battle of Gonzales) of the 1835 [Revolution](Texian)(Texian Revolution) against [Mexico](Mexico)'s [Republic](Centralist)(Centralist Republic of Mexico). A fiancée was [abducted](Captives in American Indian Wars), [scalped](scalping), and killed by [Apaches](Lipan)(Lipan Apaches) before or during his time with [F. Austin](Stephen)(Stephen F. Austin) at the [siege](Siege of Béxar) of [Cos](De)(Martín Perfecto de Cos)'s forces in [Antonio](San)(San Antonio, Texas). He was said to have been a scout under [Fannin](Col.James)(James Fannin), commissioned as a captain of the [Rangers](Texas)(Texas Ranger Division) while still 16, and to have narrowly escaped [La Portilla](De)(José Nicolás de la Portilla)'s 27 March 1836 [massacre](Goliad Massacre) of Fannin's men at [Goliad](Goliad, Texas). After the [of San Jacinto](Battle)(Battle of San Jacinto), [President](President of the Republic of Texas) [Houston](Sam)(Sam Houston) supposedly banished Glanton from Texas, although this was never enforced and no record of such an order survives. He was later said to have wounded or killed the best men on both sides of the [War](Regulator–Moderator)(Regulator–Moderator War) without supporting either side himself.\n\nGlanton was arrested in [Orleans](New)(New Orleans) on 11 March 1841 for [assault](assault), having tried to shoot a [officer](police)(New Orleans Police Department) with his pistol in the [Theatre](American)(New American Theatre), but he was dismissed with little or no punishment since no one was hurt. In early 1843, Glanton applied for a 320 [acre](acre) [grant](land grant) of land in Jackson County, Arkansas. He improved the land but, receiving no certificate of purchase, he transferred his claim to his brother Benjamin in 1845 and returned to Louisiana. He was still receiving his mail in New Orleans in September 1846 but had apparently already left for Texas.\n\n### Mexican–American War\n\nBy the time of the [War](Mexican–American)(Mexican–American War), he was part of [P. Lane](Walter)(Walter P. Lane)'s [Antonio](San)(San Antonio, Texas) [company](military company) of [Rangers](Texas)(Texas Ranger Division). Contemporary sources charged him with killing a Mexican [civilian](civilian) in [Magdalena](Magdalena, New Mexico), [Mexico](New)(Mexican New Mexico), while serving as a perimeter [sentry](sentry (military)) in 1847. Glanton defended himself, saying the civilian had ignored his commands to halt. This event brought Walter P. Lanethen a [major](major) in the armyinto conflict with his [general](U.S. army general) [Taylor](Zachary)(Zachary Taylor). Glanton evaded the [police](military)(military police) sent to arrest him\"Id.\" but then enlisted in [Coffee Hays](John)(John Coffee Hays)'s second [regiment](military regiment) of the First Texas Mounted Rifles, also informally known as the Texan Rangers.. He saw action as part of [Winfield Scott](Gen.)(Winfield Scott)'s [City campaign](Mexico)(Battle for Mexico City),Frederick Wilkins. *The Highly Irregular Regulars: Texas Rangers in the Mexican War* (1990), pp. 146–47, 158, 163. Eakin Press. during which [Private](private (military rank)) Glanton was noted by [Lane](Gen.Joseph)(Joseph Lane) to have \"attracted general notice for his extraordinary activity and daring throughout [actions](the)(Affair at Galaxara Pass) both of the 23d and 24th\" Nov. 1847 at [Pass](Galaxara)(Galaxara Pass) in [Puebla](Puebla).\n\n### Glanton Massacre\n\nIn Arizona, the Glanton organization became partners in a ferry at the [Crossing](Yuma)(Yuma Crossing) of the [River](Colorado)(Colorado River), a popular crossing for settlers and prospectors traveling to and from California during the [Gold Rush](California)(California Gold Rush). According to claims from competing ferry operators, the Glantons sometimes killed Mexican and American passengers returning from the gold-fields to take their money and goods. Other highly-sensationalized accounts claim they destroyed a boat and killed some [Quechan](Quechan)s operating a rival ferry near [Knob](Pilot)(Pilot Knob (Imperial County, California)). At dawn on April 23, 1850, a band of Quechans led by *Caballo en Pelo* killed and scalped most of the Glanton organization to establish the tribe's ferry monopoly.Braatz, Timothy. *Surviving Conquest*, 2003. p. 76 Hearing of the massacre, California officials recruited a militia in the ill-fated [Expedition](Gila)(Gila Expedition) against the Quechan tribe.\n\n\n</python_output>"}
