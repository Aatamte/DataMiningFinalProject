The hexagram can also be depicted inside a circle with the points touching it. It is often depicted in an interlaced form with the lines of the hexagram passing over and under one another to form a [knot](knot (mathematics)). It is a specific instance of the far more general shape discussed in [Pascal](Blaise)(Blaise Pascal)'s 1639 *[Mysticum](Hexagrammum)(Hexagrammum Mysticum)*.\n\n## Giordano Bruno\n\nIn his work titled *Essays upon the Mathematics of Mordente: One Hundred and Sixty Articles against the Mathematicians and Philosophers of this Age* (Prague: 1588), Italian philosopher, cosmological theorist, and Hermetic occultist [Bruno](Giordano)(Giordano Bruno) used the unicursal hexagram symbol to represent *Figura Amoris* (\"figure of love\") part of the [Trinity](Hermetic)(Hermetic Trinity) in his mathesis.\n\n## Thelema\n\n[[Image:crowley unicursal hexagram.svg|upright|thumb|An adapted unicursal hexagram is an important symbol in [Thelema](Thelema)]]\n\nIn [Crowley](Aleister)(Aleister Crowley)'s [Thelema](Thelema), the hexagram is usually depicted with a five-petalled flower in the centre which symbolises the [pentagram](pentagram). The hexagram represents the heavenly macrocosmic or planetary forces and is a symbol equivalent to the [Rosicrucian](Rosicrucianism) [Cross](Rose)(Rose Cross) or [Egypt](ancient)(ancient Egypt)ian [ankh](ankh). The five petals of the flower represent the microcosmic forces of 5 elements of the [formula](magical)(magical formula) [YHShVH](Yahshuah) and is a symbol equivalent to the pentagram or [pentacle](pentacle). The two symbols together represent the interweaving of the planetary and elemental forces.\n\n\n</python_output>"}
