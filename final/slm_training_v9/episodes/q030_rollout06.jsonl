{"type": "execution", "content": "<python_output>\n# List of largest cruise ships\n\n*Revision ID: 1158022562 | Timestamp: 2023-06-01T13:42:21Z*\n\n---\n\n[[File:Wonder of the Seas - August 2021.png|thumb|right|*[of the Seas](Wonder)(Wonder of the Seas)* is the latest ship of Royal Caribbean's  of cruise ships.]]\n\n[ship](Cruise)(Cruise ship)s are large [ship](passenger)(passenger ship)s used mainly for vacationing. Unlike [liner](ocean)(ocean liner)s, they typically embark on round-trip voyages to various ports-of-call, where passengers may go on [tours](Tourism) known as \"shore excursions\". They may carry thousands of passengers in a single trip, and are some of the largest ships in the world by the [tonnage](gross)(gross tonnage)(GT), bigger than many [ships](cargo)(List of largest container ships). Cruise ships started to exceed ocean liners in size and capacity in the mid-1990s; before then, few were more than 50,000GT. In the decades since, the size of the largest vessels has more than doubled. There have been nine or more new cruise ships added every year since 2001, most of which are 100,000GT or greater. In the two decades between 1988 and 2009, the largest cruise ships grew a third longer (268 m to 360 m), almost doubled their widths (32.2 m to 60.5 m), doubled the total passengers (2,744 to 5,400), and tripled in volume (73,000 GT to 225,000 GT). , the largest cruise ship, , has a gross tonnage of 236,857, is  long,  wide, and holds up to 6,988 passengers.\n\nCruise ships are organized much like floating hotels, with a complete hospitality staff in addition to the usual ship's crew. Modern cruise ships, while sacrificing some qualities of [seaworthiness](seakeeping), have added amenities to cater to [tourists](nautical)(nautical tourism), with recent vessels being described as \"balcony-laden floating condominiums\". The \"megaships\" went from a single deck with verandas to all decks with verandas, and feature ameneties such as theaters, fine-dining and chain restaurants, spas, fitness centers, casinos, sports facilities, and even amusement park attractions.\n\nCruise ships require electricity for powering both hotel services and for [propulsion](Marine propulsion). Cruise ships are designed with all the heavy machinery at the bottom of the ship and lightweight materials at the top, making them inherently stable even as ship designs are getting taller and taller, and most passenger ships utilize [fins](stabilizer)(Stabilizer (ship)) to further reduce rolling of tall ships in heavy weather. While some cruise ships use traditional fixed [propeller](propeller)s and [rudder](rudder)s to steer, most larger ships use propellers that can swivel left and right to steer the ship, known as [thruster](azimuth)(azimuth thruster)s, which allow even the largest ship designs to have adequate maneuverability.\n\nCruise ships are operated by [line](cruise)(cruise line)s, which are [companies](company) that market cruises to the public. In the 1990s, many cruise lines were bought by much larger holding companies and continue to operate as brands or subsidiaries of the holding company. For instance, [Corporation & plc](Carnival)(Carnival Corporation & plc) owns both the [mass-market](Mass market) [Cruise Line](Carnival)(Carnival Cruise Line), focused on larger party ships for younger travelers, and [America Line](Holland)(Holland America Line), whose smaller ships cultivate an image of classic elegance. The common practice in the cruise industry in ship sales and orders is to list the smaller operating company, not the larger holding corporation, as the recipient cruise line of the ship.\n\n\n</python_output>"}
