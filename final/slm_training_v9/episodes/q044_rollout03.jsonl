The name was coined in the 1960s by then [of State](Chief)(Chief of State of Cambodia) [Sihanouk](Norodom)(Norodom Sihanouk) to describe his country's heterogeneous, [communist](communist)-led dissidents, with whom he allied after [1970 overthrow](his)(1970 Cambodian coup d'état).\n\nThe [Rouge army](Khmer)(Kampuchea Revolutionary Army) was slowly built up in the jungles of eastern Cambodia during the late 1960s, supported by the [Vietnamese army](North)(People's Army of Vietnam), the [Cong](Viet)(Viet Cong), the [Lao](Pathet)(Path\n\n... [1630 chars truncated] ...\n\n many thousands from treatable diseases such as [malaria](malaria). The Khmer Rouge regime murdered hundreds of thousands of their perceived political opponents, and its racist emphasis on national purity resulted in the genocide of Cambodian minorities. [execution](Summary)(Summary execution)s and torture were carried out by its cadres against perceived subversive elements, or during genocidal purges of its own ranks between 1975 and 1978. Ultimately, the [genocide](Cambodian)(Cambodian genocide) led to the deaths of 1.5 to 2&nbsp;million people, around 25% of Cambodia's population.\n\nIn the 1970s, the Khmer Rouge were largely supported and funded by the [Communist Party](Chinese)(Chinese Communist Party), receiving approval from [Zedong](Mao)(Mao Zedong); it is estimated that at least 90% of the foreign aid which was provided to the Khmer Rouge came from China.}} The regime was removed from power in 1979 when [invaded Cambodia](Vietnam)(Cambodian–Vietnamese War) and quickly destroyed most of the Khmer Rouge's forces. The Khmer Rouge then fled to Thailand, whose government saw them as a buffer force against the [Vietnamese](Communist)(Communist Party of Vietnam). The Khmer Rouge continued to fight against the Vietnamese and the government of the new [Republic of Kampuchea](People's)(People's Republic of Kampuchea) until the end of the war in 1989. The [governments-in-exile](Cambodian)(Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea) (including the Khmer Rouge) held onto Cambodia's [Nations](United)(United Nations) seat (with considerable international support) until 1993, when the monarchy was restored and the name of the Cambodian state was changed to the Kingdom of Cambodia. A year later, thousands of Khmer Rouge guerrillas surrendered themselves in a government amnesty.\n\nIn 1996, a new political party called the [National Union Movement](Democratic)(Democratic National Union Movement) was formed by Ieng Sary, who was granted amnesty for his role as the deputy leader of the Khmer Rouge. The organisation was largely dissolved by the mid-1990s and finally surrendered completely in 1999. In 2014, two Khmer Rouge leaders, Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan, were jailed for life by a [Nations-backed court](United)(Khmer Rouge Tribunal) which found them guilty of [against humanity](crimes)(crimes against humanity) for their roles in the Khmer Rouge's genocidal campaign.\n\n\n</python_output>"}
