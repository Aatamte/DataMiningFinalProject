The hexagram can also be depicted inside a circle with the points touching it. It is often depicted in an interlaced form with the lines of the hexagram passing over and under one another to form a [knot](knot (mathematics)). It is a specific instance of the far more general shape discussed in [Pascal](Blaise)(Blaise Pascal)'s 1639 *[Mysticum](Hexagrammum)(Hexagrammum Mysticum)*.\n\n\n</python_output>"}
