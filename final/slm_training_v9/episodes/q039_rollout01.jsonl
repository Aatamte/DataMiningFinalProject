{"type": "execution", "content": "<python_output>\n### Ottomanism\n\n[[File:Recep Tayyip Erdoğan Mahmoud Abbas.jpg|thumb|180px|Erdoğan meeting Palestinian president Abbas in Erdoğan's [Palace](Presidential)(Presidential Compound (Turkey))]]\n\nAs President, Erdoğan has overseen a revival of [Ottoman](Ottoman Empire) tradition, greeting Palestinian president [Abbas](Mahmoud)(Mahmoud Abbas) with an Ottoman-style ceremony in the [presidential palace](new)(\tPresidential Compound (Turkey)), with [dressed](guards)(Presidential Guard Regiment (Turkey)) in costumes representing founders of [Great Turkish Empires](16)(16 Great Turkish Empires) in history. While serving as the Prime Minister of Turkey, Erdoğan's AKP made references to the Ottoman era during election campaigns, such as calling their supporters 'grandsons of Ottomans' *(Osmanlı torunu).* This proved controversial, since it was perceived to be an open attack against the republican nature of modern Turkey founded by [Kemal Atatürk](Mustafa)(Mustafa Kemal Atatürk). In 2015, Erdoğan made a statement in which he endorsed the old Ottoman term *külliye* to refer to university campuses rather than the standard Turkish word *kampüs*. Many critics have thus accused Erdoğan of wanting to become an Ottoman [sultan](sultan) and abandon the secular and democratic credentials of the Republic. One of the most cited scholars alive, [Chomsky](Noam)(Noam Chomsky), said that \"Erdogan in Turkey is basically trying to create something like the [Caliphate](Ottoman)(Ottoman Caliphate), with him as [caliph](caliph), supreme leader, throwing his weight around all over the place, and destroying the remnants of democracy in Turkey at the same time\".\n\nWhen pressed on this issue in January 2015, Erdoğan denied these claims and said that he would aim to be more like [Queen](Monarchy of the United Kingdom) [II](Elizabeth)(Elizabeth II) of the United Kingdom rather than like an Ottoman sultan.\n\nIn July 2020, after the [of State](Council)(Council of State (Turkey)) annulled the [Cabinet](Cabinet of Turkey)'s 1934 decision to establish the [Sophia](Hagia)(Hagia Sophia) as museum and revoking the monument's status, Erdoğan ordered its reclassification as a mosque. The 1934 decree was ruled to be unlawful under both Ottoman and Turkish law as Hagia Sophia's *[waqf](waqf)*, endowed by [Mehmed II](Sultan)(Mehmed the Conqueror), had designated the site a mosque; proponents of the decision argued the Hagia Sophia was the personal property of the sultan. This redesignation is controversial, invoking condemnation from the Turkish opposition, [UNESCO](UNESCO), the [Council of Churches](World)(World Council of Churches), the [See](Holy)(Holy See), and many other international leaders. In August 2020, he also signed the order that transferred the administration of the [Church](Chora)(Chora Church) to the Directorate of Religious Affairs to open it for worship as a mosque. Initially converted to a mosque by the Ottomans, the building had then been designated as a museum by the government since 1934.\n\nIn August 2020, Erdoğan gave a speech saying that \"in our civilization, conquest is not occupation or looting. It is establishing the dominance of the justice that Allah commanded in the region. First of all, our nation removed the oppression from the areas that it conquered. It established justice. This is why our civilization is one of conquest. Turkey will take what is its right in the Mediterranean Sea, in the Aegean Sea, and in the Black Sea.\" In October 2020, he made a statement before the [National Assembly](Grand)(Grand National Assembly of Turkey) that \"[Jerusalem](Jerusalem) is ours\", referring to the period of Ottoman rule over the city and the rebuilding of its [City](Old)(Old City (Jerusalem)) by [the Magnificent](Suleiman)(Suleiman the Magnificent).\n\n\n</python_output>"}
