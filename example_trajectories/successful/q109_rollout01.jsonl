Manjudō, the strange boat drifted ashore on fief of Lord Ogasawara.](File:Utsuro-Bune-Manjudō-Drifted-Ashore-on)]\n\n, also **Utsuro-fune,** and **Urobune**, was an unknown object that allegedly washed ashore in 1803 in [province](Hitachi)(Hitachi province) on the eastern coast of [Japan](Japan). When defining Utsuro-bune, the bune part means \"boat\" while Utsuro means empty, or hollow. Accounts of the tale appear in four texts: *Oushuku Zakki* (1815), *Toen shōsetsu* (1825), *Hyōryū kishū* (1835) and *Ume-no-chiri* (1844).\n\nAccording to [legend](legend), a young woman aged 18–20 years old, arrived on a local beach aboard the \"hollow ship\" on February 22, 1803. Fishermen brought her inland to investigate further, but the woman was unable to communicate in [Japanese](Japanese language). She was very different from anyone else there. The fishermen then returned her and her vessel to the sea, where it drifted away.\n\n[Historian](Historian)s, [ethnologists](ethnology) and [physicist](physicist)s such as [Tanaka](Kazuo)(Kazuo Tanaka) and [Kunio](Yanagita)(Yanagita Kunio) have evaluated the \"legend of the hollow boat\" as part of a long-standing tradition within Japanese [folklore](folklore).Kunio Yanagita, Fanny Hagin Mayer, Nihon Hōsō Kyōkai: *The Yanagita Kunio guide to the Japanese folk tale*. Indiana University Press, Bloomington (IN) 1986, , p. 176–178. Alternatively, certain [ufologists](Ufology) have claimed that the story represents evidence for a [encounter](close)(close encounter) with extraterrestrial life.\n\n## Historical sources\n\nThe best-known versions of the legend are found in four texts:\n\n* *Oushuku Zakki* (鶯宿雑記; \"Miscellaneous Notes from the Nightingale Inn\") composed by Komai Norimura around 1815.\n\n* , composed in 1825 by [Bakin](Kyokutei)(Kyokutei Bakin). The manuscript is today on display at the *Mukyū-Kai-Toshokan* at [Machida](Machida, Tokyo) ([Tokyo](Tokyo) prefecture).\n\n* , composed during the [period](Edo)(Edo period) in 1835 by an unknown author. It is today on display at the library of the [Tenri](Tenri) University at Tenri in the [prefecture](Nara)(Nara prefecture).\n\n* , composed in 1844 by Nagahashi Matajirō. It is today on display at the private library *Iwase-Bunko-Toshokan* (岩瀬文庫図書館) \n\n... [17181 chars truncated] ...\n\nhe [Forest Incident](Rendlesham)(Rendlesham Forest Incident) in England. Drawings of odd figures and unknown symbols have also been found in caves. UFO proponents further point to the woman's box, her physical appearance and unusual dress as evidence of  extraterrestrial origin. What historians and ethnologists have said about those items is repeatedly ignored.Ryūtarō Minakami, Kazuo Shimizu, Shōichi Kamon: 新・トンデモ超常現象60の真相 (= Sceptic Library, Band 6). Otashuppan, Tokyo 2007, , p. 206.\n\n## Utsuro-bune in manga and anime\n\n*Utsuro-bune* are popular motifs in [manga](manga) and [anime](anime). A prominent example appears in the television series *[Mononoke](Mononoke (TV series))* (2007), which revolves around the tales told by a traveller known as the \"medicine seller\" (薬売り). In episodes 3–5, the protagonist tells the story of *[Umibōzu](Umibōzu)*, in which a sunken Utsuro-bune features prominently. Here it is depicted as a decorated, sealed, hollow tree trunk, and contains the corpse of a young woman who had been [sacrificed](human sacrifice) to sea demons.Dani Cavallaro: Magic As Metaphor in Anime: A Critical Study. McFarland, Jefferson (N.C.) 2010, , p. 89.\n\nIn the third season of [Cities of Gold](Mysterious)(Mysterious Cities of Gold), an Utsuro-bune coming from the sunken third City has ended up in the forest near [Kagoshima](Kagoshima). When activated, it reveals a water-like [hologram](hologram) of a woman that tells the protagonists of the next key item to find.\n\nThe episode 17 of the anime series [Princess Miyu](Vampire)(Vampire Princess Miyu), titled *The Moray Boat*, is based on this legend.\n\n## References\n\n## External links\n\n* [Colorated illustrations of the Utsuro-bune, the woman and the unreadable glyphs in *Hyōryū-ki-shū*](https://web.archive.org/web/20120405045309/http://www.city.nishio.aichi.jp/nishio/kaforuda/40iwase/collection/1805hyouryukisyu/hyouryukisyu.html) (Japanese)\n\n* [Further depictions and informations around the Utsuro-bune](http://www.yaji-kita.com/ufo-1.html) (Japanese)\n\n* [Popular scientific website about the Utsuro-bune](https://web.archive.org/web/20120102032458/http://blog.strangenewsdaily.net/2010/12/the-legend-of-utsuro-bune-ancient-ufo-in-japan/) (English)\n\n[in Japan](Category:1803)(Category:1803 in Japan)\n\n[Category:Forteana](Category:Forteana)\n\n[flying objects](Category:Unidentified)(Category:Unidentified flying objects)\n\n</python_output>"}
